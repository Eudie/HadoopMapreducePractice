Christina Green, the youngest victim of a shooting spree last Saturday that claimed six lives and left Rep. Gabrielle Giffords battling for her life, will be the first to be buried in a funeral on Thursday. Hundreds of mourners began lining both sides of the road outside St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in north Tucson ahead of her funeral at 1 p.m.. A church bell signaling noon broke the quiet as mourners waited for the service. ""She showed an appreciation for life uncommon for a girl her age,"" President Barack Obama said in an emotional address to thousands of people crammed into a Tucson sports stadium to mourn on Wednesday evening. ""I want to live up to her expectations, I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it, I want America to be as good as Christina imagined it,"" he said to applause and roars of approval. The lively youngster was born on September 11 2001, the day of suicide aircraft attacks on New York. A stars and stripes flag pulled from the rubble of the World Trade Center in the days after Christina's birth was brought in to hang between two fire truck ladders. The top student, who was elected to her class council, was the granddaughter of former pro baseball manager Dallas Green. She loved dancing, gymnastics and swimming, and hoped to be the first woman to play major-league baseball. Family members escorted the small coffin into the church in silence, and the Bishop of Tucson, Bishop Gerald Kincana, is to give a blessing inside the church, which is closed to the news media. Her funeral will be followed on Friday by that of federal judge John Roll, who was gunned down alongside her after he called in at the ""Congress on the corner"" event to see Giffords, who was a friend. Police arrested a 22-year-old college dropout, Jared Lee Loughner, for the killings. He made his first court appearance on Monday, and faces five federal charges, including the attempted assassination of Giffords. The congresswoman remains in critical condition in hospital, where five other patients are being treated for gunshot wounds. Giffords opened here eyes on Wednesday, during a visit by two close friends from the U.S. Congress. (Editing by Greg McCune)"
"Breaking News - The Post Chronicle","New York Cabs Sued For Lack Of Wheelchair Accessibility","","","www.postchronicle.com","http://www.postchronicle.com/news/breakingnews/article_212343344.shtml?ref=rss","http://www.postchronicle.com/news/breakingnews","","","New York Cabs Sued For Lack Of Wheelchair Accessibility by Staff New York City taxis are facing a class-action lawsuit accusing the fleet of failing to provide enough access to passengers who use wheelchairs. The lawsuit, the first of its kind in the United States, was filed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday on behalf of a coalition that advocates for rights of people with disabilities. According to the suit, only about 1.8 percent of New York City's 13,237 taxis are accessible to wheelchair-bound passengers. The lawsuit seeks no damages but aims to have the court acknowledge that the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission violates local and federal laws by not providing more wheelchair-accessible taxis. The suit comes as the commission is poised to select a new model which will replace the city's entire fleet of taxicabs. Among the requirements specified by the city for the new model is wheelchair accessibility. Chris Noel, a member of the coalition of groups and individuals that filed the suit, said in a statement he has faced extreme difficulties getting cabs since he became handicapped. ""I have been using a wheelchair for almost ten years. I remember how easy it was for me to hail a cab when I was not using my wheelchair. But now, because there are so few taxis I can use, I often wait for an hour or more before an accessible taxi even passes me,"" he said. TLC spokesman Allan Fromberg said the commission had made an effort to accommodate handicapped passengers but said it was not bound by law to do so. ""We have made tremendous strides over the years in improving transportation options for persons with disabilities, which we continue to prioritize,"" he said. ""At the same time, no federal or local law requires that taxicabs be accessible to people with wheelchairs, and, in fact, the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) specifically exempts taxicabs from the requirement."" The suit notes that the taxi commission is not legally bound to choose a wheelchair-accessible model for the new fleet, but the transition would be ""a golden opportunity for the TLC to introduce accessible cars with minimal administrative burden and at minimal cost to drivers and medallion holders,"" said Edith Prentiss of the Taxi's for All Campaign.

Pima County Sheriff's spokesman Jason Ogan said it was not immediately clear if the bag, which was found in a dry wash by an 18-year-old man walking a dog, was connected to the shooting. ""We've recovered a black bag, we're looking to see if it's associated with our case,"" Ogan told Reuters. Ogan said there were items found inside the bag, but declined to describe them. He said the bag was being shown to Loughner's father, Randy, to see if he could identify it. Loughner, 22, is charged with five federal counts in the shooting, including the attempted assassination of Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who remains in critical condition at a local hospital with a head wound. Authorities have said that on the morning of the shooting rampage, Randy Loughner saw his son remove a black bag from the family vehicle. When Randy Loughner confronted his son over the bag, Jared Loughner fled on foot. Randy Loughner attempted to follow Jared in his vehicle, but lost sight of him.

Crude flow has been restored to 400,000 barrels per day, about two thirds normal, after operator Alyeska went ahead with a temporary start up earlier this week, and producers have restored most oil production in Prudhoe Bay, the largest U.S. oilfield. Alyeska plans to install a bypass line that will allow shipments to return to normal rates of 630,000 to 650,000 bpd, or about 12 percent of U.S. oil output. The line will remain near its current, reduced rates until it is shut down for the bypass, the operator said late Wednesday. Alaskan crude was shipped this week from storage facilities at the Valdez port terminal to keep refiners supplied while the pipeline was shut. A small leak was discovered at a pumping station along the 800-mile (1,280 kilometer) line on Saturday, forcing its shutdown. Alyeska received permission from regulators to restart the line temporarily on Tuesday, to prevent it from freezing. An administrative order from the Environmental Protection Agency requires Alyeska to take several safety steps to prevent any spilling of oil onto the gravel or tundra. It also requires Alyeska to submit a final report on the incident, including details of all response actions, by May 31. (Editing by Jim Marshall)"

The State Department's statement said the unrest has spread to Tunis and ""all major cities, including popular tourist destinations."" The events had been spontaneous and unpredictable and had several times turned violent, it said. The unrest, in its fourth week, had been confined to provincial towns and working class suburbs on the outskirts of the capital. ""While these disturbances appear to be triggered by economic concerns, and not to be directed toward Westerners, U.S. citizens are urged to remain alert to local security developments and to be vigilant regarding their personal security,"" the travel alert said.

"Breaking News - The Post Chronicle","Snow-Covered Massachusetts Lifts State Of Emergency","","","www.postchronicle.com","http://www.postchronicle.com/news/breakingnews/article_212343327.shtml?ref=rss","http://www.postchronicle.com/news/breakingnews","","","Snow-Covered Massachusetts Lifts State Of Emergency by Lauren Keiper Massachusetts lifted its state of emergency on Thursday as New England dug out from under deep snow following a winter storm that blasted the region with high winds and chilly temperatures. The storm blanketed eastern New York and western New England with anywhere from 8 inches to unofficial reports of 38 inches of snow in Berkshire County in Massachusetts, said meteorologist Brian Frugis with the National Weather Service in Albany, New York. Despite the snow from Wednesday's storm, Massachusetts emergency management teams and state police reported no major accidents. ""The road clean-up was excellent,"" said Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. ""We attribute that to the fact that folks stayed off the roads yesterday."" Massachusetts lifted the state of emergency it had declared at noon on Wednesday, at the height of the storm. Such declarations are typically made in order to gain access to emergency funding and to mobilize certain resources, such as the National Guard, to cope with the storm's impact. Power outages that affected more than 100,000 homes at the peak of the storm were reduced to just 3,500, said Judge. Traffic patterns at Boston's Logan International Airport also were returning to normal. Two active runways were available at Logan, with airlines operating at about 90 percent of a typical schedule, said Logan spokesman Phil Orlandella. Winds that were a major factor in Wednesday's storm were likely to linger in the 10 to 25 mph range, which may cause snow to blow and drift, say meteorologists. The winds were creating a significant chill in the air throughout the Northeast that was likely to keep the snow from melting, according to Accuweather.com meteorologists. Wednesday's blizzard-like conditions did set some records, including a new snowstorm record in Hartford, Connecticut of 24 inches and a new snowiest day in Worcester, Massachusetts with 21.1 inches, according to The Weather Channel. The heavy snow did not cause major outages or accidents in Vermont, said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. In fact, Bosma said the state's ski industry ""is doing backflips right now"" over the fresh snow ahead of the three-day holiday weekend. The latest storm to batter the Northeast came on the heels of separate weather systems that wreaked havoc across the South and Midwest. ""The potency of Wednesday's snowstorm came to be after two separate storm systems merged together,"" said Accuweather.com senior meteorologist Kristina Pydynowski. The storm that leveled the South with snow and ice Sunday into Monday was having lingering effects. Several southern states battled snow and ice for a fourth straight day on Thursday as overnight temperatures well below freezing slowed efforts to clear roads, but there was a sense of optimism that an end might be in sight. ""It's supposed to be 40 degrees tomorrow,"" Crystal Paul-Buchanan, spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, said. ""Freight is moving and stores are being restocked. Things are looking good."" Even so, many schools in the Atlanta area remained closed and roads remained icy in spots, but government offices and courts reopened. The upper northwest corner of South Carolina was not expected to thaw until Sunday. Roads and highways remain covered in frozen slush with patches of black ice although interstates and major roads are drivable, officials said. In Greenville, one of the state's hardest hit cities, 17 snow plows have been working around the clock.

Christina Green, the youngest victim of a shooting spree last Saturday that claimed six lives and left Rep. Gabrielle Giffords battling for her life, will be the first to be buried in a funeral on Thursday. Hundreds of mourners began lining both sides of the road outside St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic Church in north Tucson ahead of her funeral at 1 p.m.. A church bell signaling noon broke the quiet as mourners waited for the service. ""She showed an appreciation for life uncommon for a girl her age,"" President Barack Obama said in an emotional address to thousands of people crammed into a Tucson sports stadium to mourn on Wednesday evening. ""I want to live up to her expectations, I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it, I want America to be as good as Christina imagined it,"" he said to applause and roars of approval. The lively youngster was born on September 11 2001, the day of suicide aircraft attacks on New York. A stars and stripes flag pulled from the rubble of the World Trade Center in the days after Christina's birth was brought in to hang between two fire truck ladders. The top student, who was elected to her class council, was the granddaughter of former pro baseball manager Dallas Green. She loved dancing, gymnastics and swimming, and hoped to be the first woman to play major-league baseball. Family members escorted the small coffin into the church in silence, and the Bishop of Tucson, Bishop Gerald Kincana, is to give a blessing inside the church, which is closed to the news media. Her funeral will be followed on Friday by that of federal judge John Roll, who was gunned down alongside her after he called in at the ""Congress on the corner"" event to see Giffords, who was a friend. Police arrested a 22-year-old college dropout, Jared Lee Loughner, for the killings. He made his first court appearance on Monday, and faces five federal charges, including the attempted assassination of Giffords. The congresswoman remains in critical condition in hospital, where five other patients are being treated for gunshot wounds. Giffords opened here eyes on Wednesday, during a visit by two close friends from the U.S. Congress. (Editing by Greg McCune)"

The lawsuit, the first of its kind in the United States, was filed in Manhattan federal court on Thursday on behalf of a coalition that advocates for rights of people with disabilities. According to the suit, only about 1.8 percent of New York City's 13,237 taxis are accessible to wheelchair-bound passengers. The lawsuit seeks no damages but aims to have the court acknowledge that the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission violates local and federal laws by not providing more wheelchair-accessible taxis. The suit comes as the commission is poised to select a new model which will replace the city's entire fleet of taxicabs. Among the requirements specified by the city for the new model is wheelchair accessibility. Chris Noel, a member of the coalition of groups and individuals that filed the suit, said in a statement he has faced extreme difficulties getting cabs since he became handicapped. ""I have been using a wheelchair for almost ten years. I remember how easy it was for me to hail a cab when I was not using my wheelchair. But now, because there are so few taxis I can use, I often wait for an hour or more before an accessible taxi even passes me,"" he said. TLC spokesman Allan Fromberg said the commission had made an effort to accommodate handicapped passengers but said it was not bound by law to do so. ""We have made tremendous strides over the years in improving transportation options for persons with disabilities, which we continue to prioritize,"" he said. ""At the same time, no federal or local law requires that taxicabs be accessible to people with wheelchairs, and, in fact, the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) specifically exempts taxicabs from the requirement."" The suit notes that the taxi commission is not legally bound to choose a wheelchair-accessible model for the new fleet, but the transition would be ""a golden opportunity for the TLC to introduce accessible cars with minimal administrative burden and at minimal cost to drivers and medallion holders,"" said Edith Prentiss of the Taxi's for All Campaign.

The storm blanketed eastern New York and western New England with anywhere from 8 inches to unofficial reports of 38 inches of snow in Berkshire County in Massachusetts, said meteorologist Brian Frugis with the National Weather Service in Albany, New York. Despite the snow from Wednesday's storm, Massachusetts emergency management teams and state police reported no major accidents. ""The road clean-up was excellent,"" said Peter Judge, spokesman for the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency. ""We attribute that to the fact that folks stayed off the roads yesterday."" Massachusetts lifted the state of emergency it had declared at noon on Wednesday, at the height of the storm. Such declarations are typically made in order to gain access to emergency funding and to mobilize certain resources, such as the National Guard, to cope with the storm's impact. Power outages that affected more than 100,000 homes at the peak of the storm were reduced to just 3,500, said Judge. Traffic patterns at Boston's Logan International Airport also were returning to normal. Two active runways were available at Logan, with airlines operating at about 90 percent of a typical schedule, said Logan spokesman Phil Orlandella. Winds that were a major factor in Wednesday's storm were likely to linger in the 10 to 25 mph range, which may cause snow to blow and drift, say meteorologists. The winds were creating a significant chill in the air throughout the Northeast that was likely to keep the snow from melting, according to Accuweather.com meteorologists. Wednesday's blizzard-like conditions did set some records, including a new snowstorm record in Hartford, Connecticut of 24 inches and a new snowiest day in Worcester, Massachusetts with 21.1 inches, according to The Weather Channel. The heavy snow did not cause major outages or accidents in Vermont, said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. In fact, Bosma said the state's ski industry ""is doing backflips right now"" over the fresh snow ahead of the three-day holiday weekend. The latest storm to batter the Northeast came on the heels of separate weather systems that wreaked havoc across the South and Midwest. ""The potency of Wednesday's snowstorm came to be after two separate storm systems merged together,"" said Accuweather.com senior meteorologist Kristina Pydynowski. The storm that leveled the South with snow and ice Sunday into Monday was having lingering effects. Several southern states battled snow and ice for a fourth straight day on Thursday as overnight temperatures well below freezing slowed efforts to clear roads, but there was a sense of optimism that an end might be in sight. ""It's supposed to be 40 degrees tomorrow,"" Crystal Paul-Buchanan, spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, said. ""Freight is moving and stores are being restocked. Things are looking good."" Even so, many schools in the Atlanta area remained closed and roads remained icy in spots, but government offices and courts reopened. The upper northwest corner of South Carolina was not expected to thaw until Sunday. Roads and highways remain covered in frozen slush with patches of black ice although interstates and major roads are drivable, officials said. In Greenville, one of the state's hardest hit cities, 17 snow plows have been working around the clock. ""I've only been here six years, and people were telling me that this was the biggest snowstorm since 1988,"" said Mike Murphy, Greenville's director of public works.

Two active runways were available at Logan, with airlines operating at about 90 percent of a typical schedule, said Logan spokesman Phil Orlandella. Winds that were a major factor in Wednesday's storm were likely to linger in the 10 to 25 mph range, which may cause snow to blow and drift, say meteorologists. The winds were creating a significant chill in the air throughout the Northeast that was likely to keep the snow from melting, according to Accuweather.com meteorologists. Wednesday's blizzard-like conditions did set some records, including a new snowstorm record in Hartford, Connecticut of 24 inches and a new snowiest day in Worcester, Massachusetts with 21.1 inches, according to The Weather Channel. The heavy snow did not cause major outages or accidents in Vermont, said Mark Bosma, spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. In fact, Bosma said the state's ski industry ""is doing backflips right now"" over the fresh snow ahead of the three-day holiday weekend. The latest storm to batter the Northeast came on the heels of separate weather systems that wreaked havoc across the South and Midwest. ""The potency of Wednesday's snowstorm came to be after two separate storm systems merged together,"" said Accuweather.com senior meteorologist Kristina Pydynowski. The storm that leveled the South with snow and ice Sunday into Monday was having lingering effects. Several southern states battled snow and ice for a fourth straight day on Thursday as overnight temperatures well below freezing slowed efforts to clear roads, but there was a sense of optimism that an end might be in sight. ""It's supposed to be 40 degrees tomorrow,"" Crystal Paul-Buchanan, spokeswoman for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency, said. ""Freight is moving and stores are being restocked. Things are looking good."" Even so, many schools in the Atlanta area remained closed and roads remained icy in spots, but government offices and courts reopened. The upper northwest corner of South Carolina was not expected to thaw until Sunday. Roads and highways remain covered in frozen slush with patches of black ice although interstates and major roads are drivable, officials said. In Greenville, one of the state's hardest hit cities, 17 snow plows have been working around the clock. ""I've only been here six years, and people were telling me that this was the biggest snowstorm since 1988,"" said Mike Murphy, Greenville's director of public works.

The home owner surrendered the rabbits to authorities, who anticipate making a return trip to retrieve any more that may have been hiding under debris, a county police department statement said. The home in Columbia, which is situated between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., will be checked by the health department to evaluate its safety for the 46-year-old woman and her 18-year-old son who live there. Despite what the statement called ""an unclean and unsafe environment,"" the rabbits appeared to be healthy. Animal control officers have yet to determine if any criminal or civil charges will be made against the homeowner. Meanwhile the county was working with rescue groups to offer the rabbits for adoption. (Reporting by Wendell Marsh; Editing by Jerry Norton)"

An evolution of Audi's ongoing campaign to redefine luxury, the companion spot taps into viewers' notions of old luxury with the help of an unlikely literary inspiration: Goodnight Moon, the 1947 children's book by Margaret Wise Brown, one of the best-selling children's books of all time. The TV commercial titled ""Goodnight"" is inspired by the cadence and rhyme scheme of the original Goodnight Moon while taking the viewer on a journey through a traditional-style mansion laden with trite symbols of old, stuffy luxury. The 60-second spot methodically says goodnight to the age of old luxury, defined by gluttony and excess, and features the all-new 2011 Audi A8 flagship sedan, the most technologically-advanced vehicle the company has ever produced and the apex of Audi's new luxury lineup. The highly-acclaimed 2011 A8 will also be featured in Audi's upcoming Super Bowl TV spot, set to air in the first break after kick off on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 6, 2011. ""Research shows that consumer impressions are based in nostalgia and formed at a very young age. In 'Goodnight' Audi taps into these memories to break through the nostalgia and re-establish what it means to achieve luxury,"" said Scott Keogh, chief marketing officer, Audi of America. ""Today's luxury consumer exists in a world where status is no longer solely defined by tradition, but increasingly by their entrepreneurial accomplishments. As a result, they are seeking out new and more evolved luxury symbols that make them stand out from the crowd."" ""Goodnight"" begins airing Thursday, Jan 13 , across cable networks, followed by a national network debut on Sunday, Jan. 16, on CBS and FOX during the AFC and NFC divisional games. The spot also will air during the Sunday morning network news programs on ABC, CBS, FOX, and NBC. Super Bowl XLV will mark the fourth consecutive appearance for Audi, the only auto maker in its class with Super Bowl presence for four years running. Known for its aggressive and fun approach, Audi will once again deliver a fearless and intriguing Super Bowl spot that dares the viewer to re-think luxury. The 60-second TV advertisement is being created by San Francisco-based Venables Bell & Partners. ""We chose to feature the award-winning 2011 A8 because it represents today's standard of progressive luxury - sophisticated, yet memorable design, the most advanced technology available, and unmatched performance,"" said Keogh. The all new 2011 A8 sedan has been hailed as a technological masterpiece with striking aesthetics. Setting new standards of luxury, dynamism and efficiency, the A8 features a light-weight Aluminum Space Frame® body allowing it to achieve equal or greater fuel efficiency than leading luxury hybrid vehicles. Audi's flagship A8 sedan also features a 19-speaker Bang & Olufsen® sound system, MMI® touch, Audi pre-sense safety features and the Audi signature LED lighting. The past three years Audi has delivered highly-rated spots, including last year's ""Green Car"" ad featuring the Audi A3 TDI, Green Car Journal's 2010 ""Green Car of the Year,"" and a soundtrack created by rock legends Cheap Trick. The 2009 spot featured actor Jason Statham in a series of high-speed chase scenes involving luxury competitors, sending the dual message that luxury is evolving. The 2008 Audi spot delivered a parody of the movie ""The Godfather"" and signaled that the brand was ready to challenge the perceived luxury leaders by ""putting luxury on notice."" ABOUT AUDI Audi of America, Inc. and its 276 U.S. dealers offer a full line of German-engineered luxury vehicles. AUDI AG is among the most successful luxury automotive brands globally.

"Esperance Express - Front Page","Pink Lake mystery","2011-01-13T20:00:00Z","2011-01-13T20:00:00Z","www.esperanceexpress.com.au","http://www.esperanceexpress.com.au/news/local/news/general/pink-lake-mystery/2046654.aspx?src=rss","The latest news from Esperance Express","","","PINK Lake appears to be regaining its pinkish hue after around ten years of being a pale shade of its former glory. While Esperance has numerous lakes, there are few which have that intensity of pink colour, most being on private property. This distinctive colour is caused by the alga Dunaliella salina and the pink bacterium Halobacterium cutirubrum, both of which are salt tolerant. Halobacteria grows in the salt crust at the bottom of the lake, and any pink colour evident is due to a balance between the Dunaliella salina and the halobacteria. At high salinities, high temperatures and in high light, the alga accumulates the red carotenoid pigment, beta carotene (this is the same pigment as in carrots. The beta-carotene protects the alga against damage by high light and gives it the orange-red colour, which in turn colours the lake pink. Local historian, Merv Andre, points out that the lake commonly known as Pink Lake is officially named Spencer Lake. ""It's just always been known as the Pink Lake,"" he said, ""and is only one of three pink lakes in Western Australia which are coloured pink because of the alga, Dunaliella salina. ""The others are Lake Hillier on Middle Island and Hutt Lagoon, north of Geraldton. ""There might be other lakes which are pink, but it is not from Dunaliella salina."" Mr Andre says he believes the pink colour is now returning to the Pink Lake, following the closure of the local salt works last year. ""When I said I believed they were taking too much salt out of the lake and that this would have an adverse affect on the lake's colour, that was hotly contested,"" Mr Andre said. ""But I am sure that within five years, the lake will be a brilliant pink again."" Peter Lister, who was Manager of the WA Salt Supply Company, which mined salt from Pink Lake before the company finished operations mid-2010, said there were a few contributing factors to the lake's colour or lack of. ""When we have really wet years like we did in 2000, 2001 and 2005 that affects the colour,"" he said, ""and it takes a couple of years to recover from that. ""But it's the same every year, it starts to get pinker every year around mid-January to mid-February."" Mr Andre also said he had been told by ""people who are supposed to know"", that there is an underground hyper-saline stream, coming down from Norseman that feeds into Pink Lake. ""The colour of the lake is affected by its level of salinity and this is also affected by how much rainfall we get. ""So, in winter, you will find that when the lake gets to be less salty, with the inflow of winter rains, that the lake will cease to be as pink. ""It then takes some months for the alga blooms to reinstate themselves."" Mr Andre also pointed out that it was not uncommon for lakes in the area to be a variety of colours. ""My son has a property at Scaddan with ten lakes on it, and they are all different colours,"" he said. Department of Environment and Conservation (DEC) Acting District Nature Conservation Co-ordinator, Stephen Butler, said, ""Pink Lake is just one link in the chain of wetlands that encircle Esperance. These include Lake Warden, Woody Lake, Mullet Lake and Lake Monjingup. Esperance lakes are mostly salt lakes, with Shark Lake and Thistle Lake at Thistle Cove near Cape Le Grand the area's only known freshwater lakes. Lake Monjingup is close to being a freshwater lake, since its waters come from rain runoff, butit is still brackish. Dunaliella salina is the most salt tolerant alga (plant) known, and can grow in salinities as high as 35 per cent NaCI (Sodium Chloride) (seawater is approximately 3 percent NaCI). This is the highest in any organism."

The guy in Arizona this past week or the guy at Virginia Tech a couple of years ago, or the guys at Columbine didn't say to themselves, ""gee, it's against the law for me to take these guns and start killing people; therefore I'm not going to do it."" They totally ingnored not just the gun laws, but the laws period."

Michigan offensive line coach Greg Frey has been added to coach the offensive line, and Jerry Montgomery has been hired from Wyoming to coach defensive ends. This means IU needs just one more assistant, a running backs coach. WILSON ADDS THREE ASSISTANTS, ANNOUNCES STAFF REALIGNMENT BLOOMINGTON, Ind. - Rod Smith, Greg Frey and Jerry Montgomery have joined Indiana Head Football Coach Kevin Wilson's coaching staff, Wilson announced Thursday. Smith will serve as co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, while Frey will coach the offensive line and Montgomery will handle the defensive tackles. Wilson also announced plans to reorganize staff duties. Kevin Johns will join Smith as co-offensive coordinator. Johns will still coach the team's wide receivers. Mark Hagen will now be in charge of the defensive ends and remain as IU's special teams coordinator. Co-Defensive Coordinator and Safeties Coach Doug Mallory has been tabbed assistant head coach. ""We have deliberately taken time with our hires to make sure we get the right fits, not just with coaching backgrounds and pedigrees, but getting the right people to make up a cohesive unit,"" Wilson said. ""We feel the staff has come together in a very positive manner. ""I will be more involved with the offense initially and in time we will determine how we call games. I will make sure it starts out with my involvement and those guys splitting the workload that I can't do. ""I've had previous relationships with Rod Smith and Greg Frey having built some of our past offenses with Coach (Rich) Rodriguez and having continued to visit and study with those guys. It is going to be a natural transition for both of them. They are well-versed in the no-huddle style and know how to coach it. ""Jerry Montgomery is the one guy on staff I didn't personally know, but like six of our assistants, he has a Big Ten background. Jerry was a great player at Iowa and came highly recommended from a colleague. When we met him, he lit up the room. Jerry is a tremendous young coach and a great addition to our staff."" Eight of Wilson's nine full-time coaching positions are now filled. Below is a look at Indiana's staff: Defense Doug Mallory - Assistant Head Coach/Co-Defensive Coordinator/Safeties Mike Ekeler - Co-Defensive Coordinator/Linebackers Mark Hagen - Defensive Ends/Special Teams Coordinator Jerry Montgomery - Defensive Tackles Corey Raymond - Cornerbacks Offense Kevin Johns - Co-Offensive Coordinator/Wide Receivers Rod Smith - Co-Offensive Coordinator/Quarterbacks Greg Frey - Offensive Line TBA - Running Backs/Recruiting Coordinator Below are short biographies on Rod Smith, Greg Frey and Jerry Montgomery: Rod Smith - Co-Offensive Coordinator/Quarterbacks Smith coached the quarterbacks at the University of Michigan from 2008-10 after one season in the same position at West Virginia University. He helped develop two of college football's most explosive quarterbacks in U-M's Denard Robinson and WVU's Pat White. Smith originally worked at West Virginia as an offensive graduate assistant in 2001, but was quickly offered a full-time position coaching the quarterbacks and serving as pass game coordinator at the University of South Florida (2001-04). He mentored the signal-callers for four years at USF before being elevated to offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach for his final two seasons (2005-06). Smith served as an offensive coordinator at Franklin (W.Va.) High School (1997-98) and Urbana (Ohio) University (1998-2000). He also committed time as a graduate assistant at Clemson University, before his initial stint at West Virginia. Smith earned All-America honors in 1996 as a quarterback at Glenville State College, when he was a team captain for the school's fourth straight conference championship team. A native of Franklin, W.Va., Smith earned a bachelor's degree in physical education from Glenville State in 1997 and received a master's degree in teaching at Urbana in 2000. Smith and his wife, Charlene, have a son, Alex (10). Smith on Indiana: ""I am very happy to join Coach Wilson and the great staff he has assembled. My family and I are excited to be in Bloomington and can't wait to get going."" Greg Frey - Offensive Line Frey comes to Bloomington from the University of Michigan, where he served in the same capacity from 2008-10. He arrived in Ann Arbor after spending the 2007 season mentoring the offensive line at West Virginia University. Prior to WVU, Frey helped launch the University of South Florida's football program as a graduate assistant in the team's first years of existence (1996-98). He received a full-time position leading the Bulls' defensive line during the 1999 season and then moved to the opposite side of the ball, working with the offensive linemen for seven seasons (2000-06). He was a three-year letterman on Florida State University's offensive line and was a member of Bobby Bowden's national championship team in 1993, defeating Nebraska in the 1994 Orange Bowl. Frey graduated from Clearwater High School, where SuperPrep Magazine rated him the top offensive lineman in the country. He also went on to earn Parade All-America status. A native of Clearwater, Fla., Frey is a 1996 graduate of Florida State. Frey on Indiana: ""This is really a great opportunity. I am excited about being here and working with Coach Wilson. He is going to get this thing headed in the right direction and I look forward to getting to work."" Jerry Montgomery - Defensive Tackles Montgomery spent the 2009 and 2010 seasons as defensive line coach at the University of Wyoming and is quite familiar with the Big Ten, as he was a defensive tackle at the University of Iowa from 1998-01. He came to Wyoming from the University of Northern Iowa, where he helped guide the Panthers to the semifinals of the 2008 NCAA Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) playoffs and the quarterfinals of the 2007 FCS playoffs. Montgomery coached the UNI defensive line for three seasons (2006-08). Prior to coaching at Northern Iowa, he was the defensive coordinator and defensive line coach at North Iowa Area Community College for the 2005 season. He also coached at Iowa City West High School for the 2003 and 2004 campaigns. Montgomery was a four-year starter at Iowa. Following his college playing career, he went to camp with the New Orleans Saints in 2002. He later played in the Arena Football League with the Chicago Rush, Colorado Crush and Las Vegas Gladiators from 2003-2005. Montgomery played his high school football at Virgin Valley High School in Mesquite, Nev., where he was the Nevada State Player of the Year in 1997. He graduated from Iowa with a bachelor's degree in African American Studies in 2002. Montgomery and his wife, Natalie, have three sons, Jayden (6), Tevyn (5) and Jace (1).

House Bill 1063 would appropriate $36.3 million for expenses of the executive, judicial and legislative branches, including a 1.86 percent raise for Supreme Court justices, Court of Appeals judges, district and circuit judges and prosecutors. Rep. Kathy Webb, D-Little Rock, who co-chairs the Joint Budget Committee, said she asked House members to refer the bill back to Joint Budget after several Republican members said they had questions about it. ""There were some members who were concerned about the cost-of-living adjustment for the judicial branch,"" she said. Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, said the raise would be hard to justify.

Agriculture Department applies to lunches subsidized by the federal government. Schools would have to cut sodium in those meals by more than half. They'd have to use more whole grains, and serve low-fat milk. And kids would be limited to just one cup of starchy vegetables a week. That means schools couldn't offer french fries every day. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack says more than 32 million children could be affected. He says kids can consume as many as half of their daily calories in school.

Despite the introduction of electronic tracking systems designed to make it harder to bulk buy cold medications used to make methamphetamine, Federal data show that the meth trade is on the increase, Jim Salter reported for The Associated Press. In fact, Salter revealed, some believe that these tracking systems may have added to meth production by creating ""a vast and highly lucrative market for profiteers to buy over-the-counter pills and sell them to meth producers at a huge markup."" In just a few years, the lure of such easy money has drawn thousands of new people into the methamphetamine underworld. ""It's almost like a sub-criminal culture,"" said Gary Boggs, an agent at the Drug Enforcement Administration. ""You'll see them with a GPS unit set up in a van with a list of every single pharmacy or retail outlet. They'll spend the entire week going store to store and buy to the limit."" Inside their vehicles, the so-called ""pill brokers"" punch out blister packs into a bucket and even clip coupons, Boggs said. In some cases, the pill buyers are not interested in meth. They may be homeless people recruited off the street or even college kids seeking weekend beer money, authorities say. But because of booming demand created in large part by the tracking systems, they can buy a box of pills for $7 to $8 and sell it for $40 or $50. The tracking systems ""invite more people into the criminal activity because the black market price of the product becomes so much more profitable,"" said Jason Grellner, a detective in hard-hit Franklin County, Mo., about 40 miles west of St. Louis. ""Where else can you make a 750 percent profit in 45 minutes?"" asked Grellner, former president of the Missouri Narcotics Officers Association."

Phoenix, Arizona. January 11, 2011 - Reached via telephone in her office in Bakersfield, California, organizer and Chicano Movement icon Dolores Huerta speaks about the recent decision of the University of Texas at El Paso to cancel the observation of the Cesar Chavez Day, the 14th Amendment, Ethnic Studies, Arizona, and other important issues for the Latino community. Eduardo Barraza: Mrs. Huerta, what is your opinion about the UTEP's It is a disappointment, because if there was any time when Latino students and the Latino community needed support, it is now and for them to cancel it I think it's very disappointing. I don't know what the other 12 holidays are but if Columbus Day is one of them… you know what I mean? That's one that they can definitely substitute. I think for the Latino community, especially for the students for all of the reasons that you know and that you have stated of Cesar being such an example for everybody, they should definitely keep that day as a holiday. Especially since 76 percent of the students in the UTEP are Latino, there's just no excuse not to have it there. EB: What do you think about the current attempts by some legislators to modify the 14th Amendment? DH: I think it's insane, it's racist right off the back, it's ethnic cleansing, it's adding more salt to all of the wounds, and all of the insults that our community has been suffering; it's terrible. But I think the only thing that hopefully our people will get mad enough que se van a organizar (that they are going to get organized), you know what I mean? This is the only answer. We have said plainly that we know that we got the power, we got the numbers, we just got to get it together. It's important that we see all these things that are happening to us -especially in Arizona-, that we got to come together and we got to organize, we got to really use our numbers and our power in a very non-violent way so we can stop these abuses; these are political abuses that they are inflicting upon us, and it's not going to stop until we make them pay the political price. Do you know they took me out of the grammar schools in Texas? Did you hear about that? They took me out of the libros of grammar school. One of the reasons they claimed is because I was a member of an organization called the Democratic Socialists of America, which they claimed is a political party, which is not a political party, it's a private organization that John Sweeney -the head of the AFL-CIO-, Gloria Steinem, Michael Harrington, Harold Meyerson -who writes for the American Prospect Magazine-, these are all people that belong to this organization, and for that reason me quitaron (they took me out). At least that is the excuse that they used. EB: What are your thoughts regarding the Arizona Superintendent of Public Education's push to get rid of the Ethnic Studies curriculum in the Tucson Unified School District? DH: I heard Roberto Rodriguez' interview last night on Radio Bilingue, and the other professor they had -they had two professors- and they went through all of the different things that they are cutting out. But you know what? The thing is that we are going to have to start doing like they did during the 60s when we had what we called the Freedom Schools. When they did not have ethnic studies they had the Freedom Schools, and people got together and they were teaching what we called our ethnic studies. And the reason they don't want to have ethnic studies (in Tucson) is because we know that that really adds to the self esteem of our children, qué no? (is it not so?). That makes them proud of whom they are, what their heritage is, and this is of course what they need, they need to have self esteem, and they need to know their history. But at the same time we know that knowledge without action is wasted, no? So once we have knowledge of our history and our heritage then we have to act, we have to do something. So it is not enough to have the knowledge, we also got to do the action behind it. The political action that it takes to make sure the abuse doesn't continue. EB: Is the American society reverting to some of the issues you fought for during the 60s and 70s? DH: Absolutely, but you know what, it's not the American society, it's a few haters. We don't want to target everybody with that. Son unos pocos locos, (they're just a few nuts) you know what I mean; people that are haters, people that are racists, they are the ones that are doing this. It's not everybody, so we shouldn't say that it is everybody; it's just those who are using hatemongering for political advantage. We have to be careful that we don't paint everybody with the same brush. EB: What do you consider to be the most pressing issue for Latinos in Arizona? DH: Like I said before, I think the only answer is to organize. I made some comments in Tucson when they had the ethnic studies seminar (December 2010). What I said then I am going to repeat it, because, I mean, I've been around a long time and I was there during the 60s when we were going through many of the same types of situations that we're going through right now, and the only answer for us is to start organizing. No hay otra (there's no other way), you know? And if we have to march, that's important that we march. It is important that we protest. But we also have to organize because the only way that we can change is through organizing. I said this and some people took offense with me by what I said, but I am going to repeat it, because I saw even in this last election; what did we see in this last election? We saw that in Nevada that only has 12 percent Latinos, they actually put over, they were able to get (Senator) Harry Reid elected as the president of the Senate. After millions of dollars that the Republicans put in there to defeat him. But it was the Latino vote that worked for him. The same thing happened in Colorado with (Senator) Mike Bennet; he ran for the senate over there. The thing is that we know that the ultimate thing for us is to organize, and in Arizona, here you have Nevada that only has 12 percent Latino, and I don't know how many there are in Colorado, but I do know that in Arizona we have a lot of Latinos; 30 percent of the population! If in Nevada 12 percent could do what they did, what's wrong with us in Arizona? Nos falta organizarnos (we are lacking to get organized). We have to organize over there. It's important to march and everything, but we have to get people to get registered to vote. If we can register the people to vote and get them out to vote… because not everybody is a hater, you know? A lot of the people there would be on our side. But we have to go and explain, we have to explain to them what the contributions of our immigrants are, we have to go door to door. Here in California -I don't know if you know what happened in California- but all of the most liberal Democrats got elected; the most liberal Democrats! All these people got elected from San Francisco, and Berkeley and Oakland! And you know how they got elected? With the Latino votes from L.A. It was the Latino vote from Los Angeles, and these are people that are going to be on our side. I think if we can do it in California we can do it in Arizona, and Texas. I don't know qué más patadas nos tienen que dar (how many more times do we need to be kicked) so we can wake up. I was disappointed when I was in Phoenix and I was talking to other people over there that they didn't think voting was important. And they criticized me. There's a group over there and they're criticizing me because I keep saying that. But I only said that because I've seen it, I've seen the results of that and we can really win that way. He is a multimedia journalist with over two decades of experience. When he began his career, he specialized in photojournalism working for various newspapers and magazines. Later, he established an international journalistic service that provided stories and photographs to publications in Mexico and the United States. Seeking to take his experience to a deeper level, Barraza founded the Hispanic Institute of Social Issues in 1998, which has evolved since then into a grassroots multimedia publishing agency, focusing on social issues affecting Latinos and other minorities. In 2002, he founded Barriozona Magazine, a bilingual print publication that in 2006 developed into an E-zine to reach a greater audience. Barraza is also the author of the book titled ""The Shoes of the Immigrant and Other Writings"". As journalism continues to progress and is reinventing itself, Barraza has tapped into the use of digital resources to reinforce the power of a press that presents the voice of the people as opposed to ""being the voice"" of the people. As he sees new challenges arise for journalism, Barraza strives to uphold the true tenants of his beloved profession, among them truth, objectivity, and independence. LIKED THIS ARTICLE?

Lenders are poised to take back more homes this year than any other since the U.S. housing meltdown began in 2006. About 5 million borrowers are at least two months behind on their mortgages and more will miss payments as they struggle with job losses and loans worth more than their home's value, industry analysts forecast. ""2011 is going to be the peak,"" said Rick Sharga, a senior vice president at foreclosure tracker RealtyTrac Inc. The outlook comes after banks repossessed more than 1 million homes in 2010, RealtyTrac said today. That marked the highest annual tally of properties lost to foreclosure on records dating back to 2005. One in 45 U.S. households received a foreclosure filing last year, or a record high of 2.9 million homes. That's up 1.67 percent from 2009. For December, 257,747 U.S. homes received at least one foreclosure-related notice. That was the lowest monthly total in 30 months. The number of notices fell 1.8 percent from November and 26.3 percent from December 2009, RealtyTrac said. The pace slowed in the final two months of 2010 as banks reviewed their foreclosure processes after allegations surfaced in September that evictions were handled improperly. Under increased scrutiny by the government, lenders temporarily halted taking actions against borrowers severely behind on their payments. However, most banks have since resumed their eviction processes, and the first quarter will likely show a rebound in foreclosure activity, Sharga said. Foreclosures are expected to remain elevated through the year as homeowners contend with stubbornly high unemployment, tougher credit standards for refinancing and falling home values. Sharga said he expects prices to dip another 5 percent nationally before finally bottoming out. The decline will push more borrowers underwater on their mortgages. Already, about one in five homeowners with a mortgage owe more than their home is worth. The pain likely will be the most acute in states that have already been hit hard. That includes former housing boom states Nevada, Arizona, Florida and California, along with states that are suffering most from the economic downturn, including Michigan and Illinois. More than half of the country's foreclosure activity came out of five states in 2010: California, Florida, Arizona, Illinois and Michigan. Together, these states recorded almost 1.5 million households receiving a filing, despite year-over-year decreases in California, Florida and Arizona. RealtyTrac tracks notices for defaults, scheduled home auctions and home repossessions - warnings that can lead up to a home eventually being lost to foreclosure. Copyright 2011 Columbia Tribune.

LOUIS (AP) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is accusing Ameren Missouri in a lawsuit of violating the Clean Air Act at an eastern Missouri power plant. The lawsuit was filed yesterday by the Justice Department in federal court in St. Louis. It says Ameren Missouri completed major changes to its coal-fired Rush Island plant in Festus without getting the proper permit and without installing required new technologies to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide. Ameren Missouri denies the allegations, saying the work cited in the lawsuit was routine maintenance exempt from the EPA requirements. The utility says overall its emissions have been decreasing. Ameren Missouri is part of St. Louis-based Ameren Corp., which has 2.4 million electric customers in Missouri and Illinois. Copyright 2011 Columbia Tribune. All rights reserved.

The company said the move will allow it to be more flexible in operational decisions. Analysts said it's a good time to divest less-profitable businesses as energy markets recover. The Houston company had considered a spin-off two years ago but shelved it as prices for oil and gas plummeted in the recession. The refining company will be known as Marathon Petroleum Corp. and will be based in Findlay, Ohio. It's expected to be the nation's fifth-largest refiner with refineries in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast. Marathon Petroleum will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""MPC"" starting on July 1. Marathon Oil Corp. will maintain the company's exploration and production assets as well as a business that produces oil from oil sands in Alberta, Canada. Copyright 2011 Columbia Tribune.

But most other prices were largely well behaved, suggesting inflation isn't spreading through the economy. The Producer Price Index, which measures price changes before they reach consumers, rose 1.1 percent in December, the Labor Department reported today. That was up from a 0.8 percent rise in November and was the largest increase since January 2010. But outside the volatile energy and food categories, all other prices rose just 0.2 percent, down from a 0.3 percent rise in November. That lower reading on ""core"" prices indicates that inflation isn't breaking out. In fact, most of the increase in core prices last month was due to a 2.9 percent increase in cigarette prices.

The Treasury Department did gain a ""major recovery"" of taxpayer aid, $13.5 billion, by selling a chunk of its GM stock in November, the Congressional Oversight Panel said in a report issued today. And the $85 billion bailout of GM, Chrysler and auto lender GMAC - now known as Ally Financial - seems to have put them ""on the path to financial stability,"" the report said. But the companies still face uncertain futures, taxpayers remain at risk and there are concerns about the government's openness in the unprecedented rescue program, the report said. Without the rescue from the government starting in December 2008, GM, Chrysler and GMAC would have faced the financial abyss, the report said. Their failure would have been a crushing blow on the economy. The Obama administration has said the rescue was needed to prevent the loss of at least a million jobs and economic devastation in the industrial Midwest. Administration officials have said they never expected to recoup the full investment. An earlier estimate by the Congressional Budget Office that taxpayers would lose $40 billion on the auto industry rescue has been slashed to $19 billion, the oversight panel noted. GM was pushed into bankruptcy protection by the Obama administration. It emerged in 2009 with a balance sheet cleansed of its staggering debt. The company has made an impressive turnaround from losing billions before its restructuring to posting $4.2 billion in profits in the first nine months of last year. Still, the report said, by selling 45 percent of its GM shares for $33 each in the automaker's $15.8 billion initial public offering in November, Treasury ""locked in"" a loss of billions of dollars and diminished the likelihood of full repayment to taxpayers. The ""break-even"" price needed for that is $44.59 a share, according to the report. Government officials say that GM's stock price averaged only 3 percent above $33 in the month after the IPO, confirming that it was fairly priced. ""These are always tough decisions,"" Sen. Ted Kaufman, D-Del., the panel's chairman, said in a conference call with reporters yesterday. Treasury's decisions ""may well have been reasonable"" but the rescue program's objectives should have been more clearly defined, he said. GM's stock price has been rising as the company has performed better than many expected. It closed yesterday at $38.62. If the trend continues, it's possible that taxpayers could be made whole.

But the long, low barns had been empty for less than a week last month when the cows came home again. Today, the dairy is in operation as one of four rented locations Jeremy and Jerald Visser are using to expand their herd. The Bartelheimers sold 750 mature cows, some to the Vissers, and leased the dairy to the family. As a result, the Bartelheimers paid off debt and made their mortgage payments, and owner Dale Bartelheimer, 73, was able to retire. It's tough to make a living in the dairy business these days, but those who find economical ways to grow have a better chance of surviving, said Ned Zaugg, Washington State University Extension's dairy expert. The Vissers - son Jeremy and father Jerald - believe the arrangement will be beneficial by giving them a place to expand their herd - and potential profit - without the costs of land ownership. Most Washington dairies are family-operated, a number of them by people such as the Bartelheimers and Vissers, who have been in the business for generations. But the high cost of feed and low price of milk mean the family-owned dairy is a dying breed. When Zaugg came to the Northwest in 1993, Snohomish and Skagit counties each had more than 100 dairies. Strict state environmental rules were implemented in 1997. Now there are about 25 in each, he said. ""It is a crisis,"" he said. Dairy farms also affect nearby towns, he said. Depending on the economy, every 100 cows represent $1 million to $2 million in income to surrounding communities, Zaugg said. Towns near a dairy often are small and have benefited from the dairy families' involvement for years. ""These people are the salt of the earth,"" he said. ""They work hard; they don't complain about it. They appreciate natural resources because that's their livelihood. These are the communities where they raise their children."" The Visser family came from the Netherlands in the early 1900s and settled on the farm in Sumas, Wash., where Jeremy Visser, 33, lives today with his wife and 2-year-old son. In 1999, the dairy was about to go under. That's when Jeremy went into partnership with his father, Jerald, and made an ambitious plan to expand their operation. They began leasing other properties and expanded the herd from 140 to 3,000 today. With a bigger herd comes increased responsibilities and risks, Visser said: ""I can't afford to make mistakes."" The year 2009 was the worst for the dairy industry, he said. That's when milk prices dropped to their lowest, $11.76 for about 12 gallons, while the price of feed remained high. Local dairies were paid $14.20 for the same amount of milk in 2005, and the rate today is about $15, Visser said. Feed prices are high for several reasons. Prime locally grown hay is shipped to lucrative markets overseas - Saudi Arabia, for example, Bartelheimer said. That makes available hay more expensive. Alfalfa, corn and soy beans are all part of a cow's diet, and corn prices are high now, too, Visser said, because it's in demand for ethanol. ""Unfortunately for a lot of agriculture, when one does well, another pays the penalty,"" Zaugg said. ""No man is an island when it comes to this picture."" The Bartelheimers wouldn't have been able to stay on the land had a tenant not been found, said Jason Bartelheimer, 39. ""For the last two years, we've been losing money,"" he said. ""The dairy economy went with the rest of the economy."" Jason Bartelheimer is doing what many dairymen are doing to stay on their farms: He's planning to make farmstead cheese, and he bought 42 calves from the herd his father sold. He has taken cheese-making classes and practiced in the farmhouse kitchen. Bartelheimer said he knows it will take time to make money in the cheese business and that he'll have to find another job in the interim. His friends jokingly tell him he needs a night job to support his ""farming habit."" Copyright 2011 Columbia Tribune. All rights reserved.

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R., Va.) said Thursday lawmakers would resume their regularly scheduled work next week. ""As the White House noted, it is important for Congress to get back to work, and to that end we will resume thoughtful consideration of the health care bill next week,"" Mr. Cantor said in a statement released by his office. ""Americans have legitimate concerns about the cost of the new health care law and its effect on the ability to grow jobs in our country. It is our expectation that the debate will continue to focus on those substantive policy differences surrounding the new law."" Congressional leaders halted consideration of the health-care repeal bill after a shooting spree in Tucson saw six people killed and a Democratic House lawmaker critically wounded. Instead, lawmakers have spent the week honoring their colleague, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and the other victims of the tragedy. Given the size of the GOP majority in the House, the vote is widely expected to be successful in that chamber. But the matter is unlikely to be taken up by the Senate, which Democrats still control. Democrats view the health-care overhaul as their signature domestic policy achievement during the first two years of President Barack Obama's term. Republicans have said they will pursue alternatives to the existing health-care law, although so far they haven't divulged details of what their plan would look like.

Yields on the 10-year (UST10Y) note were down 5 basis points to 3.32%, while yields on 2-year notes (UST2YR) were off 2 basis points at 0.58%. Yields move inversely to prices. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. The market found some direction after the Fed bought $8.412 billion worth of Treasurys as part of its quantitative easing program. The purchase surpassed some analysts' forecasts and was toward the upper end of a range of $7 billion to $9 billion the Fed had told dealers to expect. After a midday rally, Treasurys lost some steam after the Treasury Department said it sold $13 billion in 30-year bonds at a yield of 4.515%. Bidders offered 2.67 times the amount of bonds on offer, matching an average of the past 12 auctions. Indirect bidders -- a category that includes foreign central banks -- bought 38% of the bonds, up from a 12-auction average of 36.5%. Direct bidders, including domestic money managers, took 12% vs. an average 16.4%. Yields on 30-year bonds (UST30Y) were recently up 3 basis points at 4.50%. The sale followed two earlier in the week that showed strong demand. On Wednesday, Treasury sold $21 billion in 10-year notes at a yield of 3.388%, with bidders seeking 3.3 times the amount offered, or the most demand since April. Tuesday's sale of 3-year notes was also considered decent. Stocks fell, hurt by an uptick in jobless claims and disappointing news from Merck & Co.(MRK)., and freeing up some capital for safety plays like gold and bonds. The moves came after government data showed applications for jobless benefits rose 35,000 last week to their highest levels in two months -- though within the recent range of about 450,000 claimants. Also Thursday, analysts at both Moody's Investors Services Inc. and Standard & Poor's warned the U.S. on its credit rating, according to a report by Dow Jones Newswires. ""We have become increasingly clear about the fact that if there are not offsetting measures to reverse the deterioration in negative fundamentals in the U.S., the likelihood of a negative outlook over the next two years will increase,"" said Sarah Carlson, senior analyst at Moody's, in an interview. In other economic data, U.S. wholesale prices rose 1.1% in December, according to the Labor Department.

"columbiatribune.com stories","Illinois’ neighbors licking chops","2011-01-13T18:47:33Z","2011-01-13T18:47:33Z","www.columbiatribune.com","http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/2011/jan/13/illinois-neighbors-licking-chops/","columbiatribune.com stories","","","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) - While many states consider boosting their economies with tax cuts, Illinois officials are betting on the opposite tactic: dramatically raising taxes to resolve a budget crisis that threatens to cripple state government. Neighboring states gleefully plotted yesterday to take advantage of what they consider a major economic blunder and lure business away from Illinois. ""It's like living next door to 'The Simpsons' - you know, the dysfunctional family down the block,"" Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels said in a radio interview. But economic experts scoffed at images of highways packed with moving vans as businesses leave Illinois. Income taxes are just one piece of the puzzle when businesses decide where to locate or expand, they said, and states should be cooperating instead trying to poach jobs from one another. ""The idea of competing on state tax rates is … hopelessly out of date,"" said Ed Morrison, economic policy advisor at the Purdue Center for Regional Development. ""It demonstrates that political leadership is really out of step with what the global competitive realities are."" By going where no other state dares to tread, Illinois could prove itself to be a policy pacesetter or the opposite - a place so dysfunctional that officials created a jaw-dropping budget crisis and then tried to fix it by kneecapping the economy. Illinois faced a budget deficit of $15 billion in the coming year, equivalent to more than half the state's general fund. Officials warned that state government might not be able to pay its employees. It certainly would fall further behind in paying the businesses, charities and schools that provide services on the state's behalf. To avoid that, the Democrat-controlled General Assembly voted to temporarily raise personal income taxes 66 percent, from 3 percent to 5 percent. Corporate rates will rise, too - from 4.8 percent to 7 percent - when Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn signs the measure. The increase is expected to produce $6.8 billion a year for the four years it's in full effect. That should be enough to balance Illinois' annual budget and begin chipping away at a backlog of roughly $8 billion in old bills. The tax move inspired a day of taunts across state borders and finger-pointing between parties. ""Years ago Wisconsin had a tourism advertising campaign targeted to Illinois with the motto, 'Escape to Wisconsin,' "" Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said in a statement. ""Today we renew that call to Illinois businesses, 'Escape to Wisconsin.' You are welcome here."" Illinois state Sen. Dan Duffy, a Republican, labeled the tax increase ""the nuclear bomb of jobs bills."" There was even some carping from Illinois Democrats. Chicago Mayor Richard Daley predicted jobs will start trickling out of Illinois with little fanfare. ""Businesses don't have press conferences like this and announce they're moving 50 people out, 60 people out, 70 people,"" Daley said at an event in Chicago. Across the Mississippi River, the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry said it is looking for ways to help Missouri take advantage of Illinois' tax increases. And state lawmakers see potential to attract new businesses. Rep. Denny Hoskins, R-Warrensburg, said the Illinois tax increases could help Missouri recruit new companies. A House committee yesterday took up Hoskins' bill to offer small businesses a tax deduction for hiring new employees. But Illinois' governor rejected the idea that the increase would allow other states to lure jobs away. ""Lots of luck to them, but that's not going to happen,"" Quinn said at a news conference yesterday. Businesses look at more than taxes when making financial decisions, Quinn said. They also look at whether state government is stable and able to provide good roads and schools. ""It's important for their state government not to be a fiscal basket case,"" Quinn said. A Wisconsin company seemed to prove his point. Train maker Talgo Inc. is threatening to leave Milwaukee because Wisconsin rejected federal funds for high-speed rail. Talgo considers Illinois a strong possibility for its new the company's new home despite the tax hike, said spokeswoman Nora Friend. The tax increase ""would not weigh in as a positive, but it's difficult to say whether it's the deciding factor,"" Friend said. ""It would be one more factor that gets weighed in.""

""As the White House noted, it is important for Congress to get back to work, and to that end we will resume thoughtful consideration of the health care bill next week,"" Mr. Cantor said in a statement released by his office. ""Americans have legitimate concerns about the cost of the new health care law and its effect on the ability to grow jobs in our country. It is our expectation that the debate will continue to focus on those substantive policy differences surrounding the new law."" Congressional leaders halted consideration of the health-care repeal bill after a shooting spree in Tucson saw six people killed and a Democratic House lawmaker critically wounded. Instead, lawmakers have spent the week honoring their colleague, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, and the other victims of the tragedy. Given the size of the GOP majority in the House, the vote is widely expected to be successful in that chamber. But the matter is unlikely to be taken up by the Senate, which Democrats still control. Democrats view the health-care overhaul as their signature domestic policy achievement during the first two years of President Barack Obama's term. Republicans have said they will pursue alternatives to the existing health-care law, although so far they haven't divulged details of what their plan would look like.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the product, determined that the Applied Biosystems TaqMan Salmonella enteritidis Detection Kit is just as accurate, precise and sensitive as traditional methods of salmonella detection. The biotechnology tools company was able to do some by utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction to quickly determine the presence or absence of salmonella in egg samples. While standard methods typically take 10 days to return results, the Life kit reaches them in roughly 27 hours, making it the fastest on the market. ""The faster turnaround time to reach accurate results with this new molecular test not only enables egg producers to easily conform to the FDA's new stringent testing standards, but also helps limit the negative economic impact associated with SE outbreaks,"" said Gene Gregory, CEO of the United Egg Producers. Life worked with Dr. Shelley Rankin of the veterinary school to develop the test in response to new more stringent federal regulations about salmonella detection. The move follows a massive recall in 2010 where the nation's two largest egg producers were forced to recall more than 550 million eggs, affecting 26 states and resulting in a 40% hike in egg prices. In July, the Federal Egg Safety Program was established and required all large-scale egg producers in the U.S., or roughly 80% of the egg production industry, to test for salmonella to ensure the eggs are safe before they reach supermarket shelves. The regulation resulted in the need for quicker, yet still highly accurate testing method. Rankin, who serves as an associate professor of microbiology at Penn Vet, said the FDA approval marks a milestone for the U.S. egg industry."

The drug company said it made changes in two trials for the experimental cardiovascular medicine, vorapaxar, as per a data and safety monitoring board's suggestion.

One of the trials, called the Tracer study, which target patients with acute coronary syndrome, will be discontinued in what Merck called a ""timely and orderly fashion."" The TRA-2P trial, which targets patients with prior heart attack, stroke and peripheral artery disease, will be immediately discontinued in patients with a history of strokes, however experiments will continue on patients with previous heart attacks or peripheral arterial disease, which make up roughly 75% of participants. Merck said it plans on updating its projections for regulatory filings for vorapaxar once it receives the efficacy and safety data from Tracer, slated for later this year, and can determine an updated completion date for TRA-2P.

Supply in January and February would be ""tight as well,"" he added. The supply could cap Microsoft's potential but could lead to ""amazing"" year-over-year growth. Most of the growth can be attributed both to the usual holiday upswing but also to the November 4 intro of Kinect.

The console ran out of stock at the end of December and will have prevented Microsoft from beating Nintendo's Wii in the NPD sales charts. Supply in January and February would be ""tight as well,"" he added. The supply could cap Microsoft's potential but could lead to ""amazing"" year-over-year growth. Most of the growth can be attributed both to the usual holiday upswing but also to the November 4 intro of Kinect. The motion controller helped Microsoft outsell Nintendo in November when comparing TV gaming by attracting not just veteran gamers but those who would never have considered an Xbox 360 before. CES 2011 keynote said it had sold over eight million Kinect devices in the past 60 days, some of which were attached to new systems. shortages have been regular in the past few years. Microsoft has usually characterized it as a matter of sheer demand, but the company has often been conservative with supply.

Benefits: Post comments NEW CITY, New York (AP) - Former football star Lawrence Taylor pleaded guilty Thursday to sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute, misdemeanor charges that carry no jail time but require him to register as a sex offender. The 51-year-old ex-National Football League linebacker, who led the New York Giants to Super Bowl titles in 1987 and 1991, will serve six years probation. ""She told me she was 19,"" Taylor said in court as he admitted having sex with a prostitute who turned out to be a 16-year-old Bronx runaway. Taylor said he now knows the girl was legally incapable of consent. Prosecutor Patricia Gunning said the plea deal was acceptable in part because Taylor had assisted in investigations into human trafficking. Another prosecutor, Arthur Ferraro, said outside court that Taylor ""was of assistance in the field of human trafficking in several jurisdictions and with federal authorities."" Taylor previously had pleaded not guilty to third-degree rape, patronizing a prostitute, sexual abuse and endangering a child. He was arrested May 6 after the underage girl's uncle contacted New York City police. Officers woke him at a Holiday Inn in Montebello in Westchester County, north of New York City. In a related case, federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed a complaint last year against a man who is accused of acting as the girl's pimp. Ramapo police Chief Peter Brower said after Taylor's arrest that ignorance of a minor's age is not a defense to third-degree rape. Taylor was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999. A fierce, athletic linebacker, he redefined his position and was selected to the NFL's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. Previous article Authorities: Pa. man talked to terrorism suspects"

Benefits: Post comments WASHINGTON (AP) - Unconstitutional Avenue? No Vote Street? Statehood Way? Those are just a few of the suggestions that some Washington residents have proposed for renaming Pennsylvania Avenue - of White House fame - to highlight their lack of statehood. Backers of the idea to rename the capital's most prominent avenue, or part of it, say such a step would underscore the fact that the city's 600,000 residents have no vote in Congress. D.C. Council member Michael A. Brown planned a meeting Thursday evening to seek input on ceremonially renaming Washington's most celebrated avenue. No one would take down any street signs if officials ultimately agree on a new name, but ceremonial street designation signs could go up under the existing Pennsylvania Avenue signs. Because Congress has final say over city laws, any proposal could be rejected on Capitol Hill. ""Pennsylvania Avenue is the main thoroughfare between the Capitol and the White House. I think it represents government to a lot of people,"" said Brown, who already has collected more than a dozen proposals for a new name. ""It's still our city street."" The White House is at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., but other important buildings also line the avenue including the FBI building, Washington's city hall and the White House visitor center. The street is also famous for being part of the route a new president follows during every inaugural parade. This isn't the first time Washington residents have come up with attention-grabbing ways of getting their point across about representation.

Ice Hockey","","Series Spotlight: Mallory Deluce on St. Cloud State Senior forward Mallory Deluce"" width=""150"" height=""250"" /> -- In preparation for this weekend's games, UWBadgers.com caught up with senior forward Mallory Deluce (London, Ontario) to get her take on the Badgers' series against St. Cloud State at the Kohl Center this weekend. Q: How does it feel to have the whole team back together after having players gone at the USA Hockey training camp and the MLP Cup over the last couple weeks? Deluce: It's really nice to finally be back together as a group and have a full roster for practices. Q: What was it like playing for Canada's National Women's Under-22 Team at the MLP? Deluce: It was a lot of fun, a great experience being in a new place this year, Kreuzlingen, Switzerland. It was nice to play with Canada against all of the other countries. The games were just a lot of fun. Q: What will it be like to finally get back on the ice at the Kohl Center this weekend? Deluce: It's definitely nice to be back home and have our own fans and sleep in our own rooms. It's nice to be back at the Kohl Center and be back to our home routine. Q: What makes the Kohl Center so special? Deluce: I would say the fans, having them there cheering us on makes it fun playing at the Kohl Center. Also, the atmosphere of the Kohl Center, the big ice, and just being home make it special. Q: What is it like playing a team like St. Cloud State twice in such a short time period? Deluce: It's nice to have played them recently because we know some of their tendencies. We know they have a good goalie, so we'll focus on taking lots of shots. I think we'll try to reinforce the good habits we had in the last series against St. Cloud State and focus on what we did well in that series. Q: Have you ever been on a team that has struggled to win games the way St. Cloud State has this season? Deluce: When I was younger, there were times that I was on a team that wasn't as good. I think St. Cloud State just has to stay positive. They have a good group of girls. Sometimes games are close, but it just doesn't go in your favor, and that makes it hard. They have to try to stay positive. No. 1 Wisconsin (20-2-0, 14-2-0 WCHA) returns to the Kohl Center for the first time in six weeks when the Badgers host St. Cloud State (0-20-1, 0-15-1-1 WCHA) this weekend. UW swept the Huskies in the last meeting between the teams with a 5-0 shutout on Dec. 10 and a 6-1 victory Dec. 11 on the road in St. Cloud, Minn.

Featuring major technology contributions from AMD's Markham, Ontario R&D facility, the AMD Fusion Family of Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) incorporate multi-core CPU (x86) technology, and a powerful DirectX ® 11-capable graphics and parallel processing engine within the design. ""AMD Fusion technology enables significant breakthroughs in personal computing. It represents a major advancement in processor technology that will open up exciting new experiences for consumers,"" said Ben Bar-Haim, general manager, AMD Canada. ""Our AMD R&D facility in Markham, Ontario has played a pivotal role in bringing the remarkable AMD Fusion technology to life and we are incredibly proud that the AMD Canada team's contribution will help power computers throughout Canada and around the world."" Vital contributions from Canadian engineers, including video processing and display technology development, were integral to making AMD Fusion processors a success. In February 2010, AMD Canada was awarded a five-year grant of $56.4 million CAD from the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development and Trade under Ontario's Next Generation of Jobs Fund. The grant helped to fund R&D activities by AMD's Markham-based engineers in the development of the AMD Fusion family of processors, related software infrastructure and integrated computing platforms. In turn, and resulting from this grant, AMD has invested nearly $150 million CAD in AMD Fusion processor-related R&D activities in Markham since April 2009, and created nearly 200 new AMD Fusion-related jobs in 2010. ""Innovation is the key to prosperity in the global economy and the government of Ontario is proud to have partnered with AMD in developing the groundbreaking AMD Fusion APU,"" said Minister of Economic Development and Trade, Sandra Pupatello. ""The AMD Fusion APU solidifies the GTA's growing worldwide reputation as a hub for the digital computing industry."" ""It is fitting that AMD chose the Science Centre for this announcement,"" said Lesley Lewis, CEO, Ontario Science Centre. ""Every day, we encourage our visitors of all ages to consider the numerous ways in which science and technology affect their lives and our future."" If one were to build a Fusion chip out of 1940s-style vacuum tubes, it would cover an area equivalent to about 70 square kilometres of the city of Toronto -- from the Don Valley Parkway, over to the 427 and as far north as Eglinton Avenue. To power that, one would need the equivalent of 40 gigaWatts of electricity, enough power for 20 million people, or roughly 80 CANDU nuclear reactors -- the same power generated by over 13 Pickering power plants. By contrast, the AMD E-Series Fusion APUs have an area of 75 sq mm -- smaller than a typical thumbnail or alpha key on a PC keyboard -- and require less power than a compact fluorescent light bulb(i). The AMD Fusion chip delivers an unprecedented experience starting with thin and light notebooks, as well as small form factor desktops: stutter-free HD video playback, breakthroughs in computational horsepower to handle the most demanding applications(ii), and all-day battery life(iii). Tablets and embedded designs based on AMD Fusion APUs are expected be available later in Q1 2011. AMD's Canada operations are based in Markham, Ontario. As AMD's largest R&D centre outside the United States, AMD Canada has a total workforce of more than 1,800 people, including regular, co-op, temporary and contract employees. During the past five years, AMD has invested more than $1 billion dollars in R&D activities in Canada.

(""Strateco"")(TSX:RSC)(FRANKFURT:RF9)(OTCBB:SRSIF) is pleased to report that drilling will resume on the various properties of the Matoush project, located in the Otish Mountains, about 275 km north of Chibougamau, Quebec. Phase I of the 2011 program, which will consist of about 30,000 metres of drilling, will begin on January 14, with two drills in operation. This phase of drilling is centered on the Matoush property (100%-owned), Pacific Bay-Matoush property (option on 60%) and Mistassini property (option on 60%), and is part of a massive 120,000-metre program that began in October 2009. Over 43,600 metres have been drilled to date. Matoush Property On the Matoush property, a Major 50 drill will first complete the current hole (MT-10-017) on the new MT-36 lens, confirmed in the fall of 2010. This lens lies 1.5 km south of the MT-34 zone. To date, the two best intersections are from holes MT-09-036 (0.48% U 3O8 over 4.2 metres including 1.29% U3 O8 over 1.2 metres) and MT-10-011 (0.33 % eU 3O8 over 5.1 metres including 2.21% eU3 O8 over 0.70 metres). Three other holes intersected the new MT-36 lens in the upper part of the ACF-4: MT-09-035 (0.17% U 3O8 over 2.0 metres), MT-10-009 (0.10% eU 3O8 over 1.0 metre) and MT-10-013 (0.10% eU 3O8 over 8.8 metres). These results are representative of the values intersected in and around the AM-15, MT-22 and MT-34 zones. The uranium mineralization of the MT-36 lens appears to be concentrated in the upper part of the ACF-4 horizon, as it is in the MT-22 and MT-34 lenses. To date, the mineralization has been traced over a distance of 300 metres. The hole locations and results to date are indicated on the MT-36 longitudinal section posted on Strateco's website, at www.stratecoinc.com. Mistassini Property A heli-portable drill will be mobilized on the Mistassini property (option on 60%), 50 km southwest of the Matoush property, as of January 14. A program of about 1,000 metres will be carried out in the coming weeks. It should be recalled that the drilling program conducted on the Mistassini property in June 2009 yielded very encouraging results, leading to the discovery of a new mineralized zone. The new uranium-bearing zone was intersected in the immediate area of the Lac Mantouchiche uranium showing (""the Mantouchiche showing""). Hole MIST-09-003, drilled at an angle of -45°, intersected 11.6 metres grading 0.21% U 3O8, including 0.8 metres grading 2.20% U 3O8. This new uranium zone lies in the hanging wall of the Mantouchiche showing, at a vertical depth of 32 metres. The Mantouchiche showing discovery hole, MIST-07-003, drilled at an angle of -70° on the same section as Hole MIST-09-003, intersected 18.5 metres grading 0.22% U 3O8 at a vertical depth of 47 metres. Another hole, Hole MIST-09-004, drilled on the same section at an angle of -70°, confirmed the vertical extension of the new uranium zone, with a grade of 0.06% U 3O8 over 13.5 metres, including 0.12% U 3O8 over 5.3 metres, at a vertical depth of 40 metres. Hole MIST-09-003 also intersected the extension of the Mantouchiche showing, this time at a vertical depth of 64 metres, with a grade of 0.07% U 3O8 over 3.0 metres, including 0.12% U 3O8 over 1.3 metres. The current program consists of drilling ten holes about 100 metres deep to confirm the continuity of the mineralized zones. Under the terms of an agreement signed between Strateco and Majescor Resources Inc. on November 27, 2008, Strateco has the option to acquire a 60% interest in the uranium rights on the Mistassini property by spending a total of $1.3 million on exploration over a three-year period, including a total firm commitment of $500,000 for the first year of the option. Strateco will have earned its 60% interest by the end of the current drilling program. The Mistassini property consists of 171 claims covering an area of 9,115 hectares. Pacific Bay-Matoush Property As soon as the heli-portable drill program on the Mistassini property is complete, a Major 50 drill will be mobilized on the Alfred fault on the Pacific Bay-Matoush property, 4 km west of the Matoush fault. In early October 2010, three holes were drilled to test a north-south striking structure similar to the Matoush fault, located on the Pacific Bay-Matoush property 4.0 km west of the Matoush fault. The holes intersected a Matoush-type fault called the Alfred fault, with identical alterations to the Matoush fault, over a distance of 365 metres. The geophysical anomaly indicates that the Alfred fault extends northward and southward. This was one of the most important discoveries on the Matoush project outside the Matoush fault corridor. The holes, which intersected low uranium grades, demonstrated that other Matoush-type structures (faults) exist elsewhere on the Matoush project. The initial holes of the 2011 program will test the northward extension of the Alfred fault. Approximately 5,500 metres of drilling are planned on the Pacific Bay-Matoush property as a whole in 2011. In addition to the recently discovered Alfred fault area, the Rabbit Ears area, 9 km northeast of the Matoush deposit, is also of interest. Strateco is in the process of acquiring a 60% interest in the Pacific Bay-Matoush property. The 2011 exploration budget is approximately $1.1 million. In addition to the exploration work planned for 2011, Strateco must make a cash payment of $175,000 and issue 70,000 shares on or before October 29, 2011, to earn its 60% interest.

(""TRUSTCASH"" or the ""COMPANY"") ( TCHH) today comments on corporate developments. BUSINESS OVERVIEW TrustCash's business model, in the past, was focused on expanding through acquisitions. Amongst other things, economic and stock market conditions have not been conducive to affect such a strategy. The Company's ongoing focus is aimed at improving its balance sheet and income statements. To do so the Company has: a) implemented plans to develop its technology platform for increased revenue streams; b) restructured and or settled substantially all of the Company's debt obligations and; c) reduced expenses by, amongst other things, operating as a internet/virtual company. Outsourcing customer and technical support results in a long term leased physical office not being required for staff and thus reduces overhead.

But there are some things the ads don't say. Things like: - Tar sands oil is more acidic, corrosive and explosive and contains more toxic chemicals. It's more likely to spill and more likely to endanger public health when it does. - Pipeline overcapacity raises shipping costs and forces Americans to pay artificially higher gas prices. In response, DirtyOilSands.org, a coalition of U.S. and Canadian groups campaigning to stop the pipeline, has annotated the script of a TransCanada ad that ran Jan. 5 on Washington's WTOP-FM.

Canada Economic Development's intervention aims to assist lobster industry representatives in their mobilization, search for innovative solutions and new market development initiatives. ""With this assistance for these three projects, the Government of Canada is demonstrating its commitment to supporting the development of a sustainable lobster fishery that promotes the viability of this important sector of the region's economy,"" explained the Minister of State. Launch of lobster larvae hatchery A contribution of $206,641 was granted for the implementation of a lobster hatchery in Chandler. The decrease in fishery landings and changes in ocean currents in Gaspésie have convinced the Regroupement's fishermen of the relevance of lobster larvae stocking, an activity complementary to the various conservation measures already in place. This approach aims to ensure a constant supply of the resource and the sustainability of this major industry. Two stockings were conducted in 2010. Showcasing the culture and heritage of the coastal fishery Funding of $239,000 was awarded to implement a pilot project on tourist commercial fishing in summer 2011. A feasibility study has already confirmed the interest of vacationers for a recreational activity of this kind, which would both improve the tourism offering and diversify fishers' revenue streams. Study on new control procedures for monitoring dockside weighing A third contribution, of $57,600, was granted to conduct a technical and financial feasibility study to compare the conventional dockside weighing system with other alternatives: the goal being to obtain reliable catch data related to management of the resource and the scientific process. The Canadian lobster industry is experiencing challenging economic times. The decrease in profitability due to the constant rise in operating costs, combined with declining U.S. market prices, has resulted in significant financial losses for many fishers. ""The diversity of the projects is indicative of progress in development and innovation in the lobster industry. Canada Economic Development is proud to partner in these initiatives which will generate a host of economic benefits for the region,"" concluded Mr. Lebel. These projects have been funded through the Community Adjustment Fund (CAF) - Lobster component announced in May 2009 and established under Canada's Economic Action Plan. With an allocation of $2 million for Quebec, CAF - Lobster component supports projects that help to maintain jobs related to lobster fishing; it is estimated that there are nearly 350 such jobs in Gaspésie. The three financial contributions granted by Canada Economic Development are in addition to the amount already announced by Fisheries and Oceans Canada for the implementation of the the RPPSG's sustainability plan under the Atlantic Lobster Sustainability Measures (ALSM) program.

Broughton heads up Corporate Sustainability at Enterprise Holdings, which owns and operates Alamo Rent A Car and National Car Rental as well as its flagship Enterprise Rent-A-Car brand. He is scheduled to address Car Rental Show attendees during the Wednesday, March 9, breakfast session, and will discuss the importance of the car rental industry developing a sector-specific position on sustainability reporting and transparency.

"Marketwire - Breaking News Releases","Excellon Announces Final 2010 Assays From the High-Grade Pierna Manto and Provides an Exploration Update","2011-01-13T20:21:00Z","2011-01-13T20:21:00Z","www.marketwire.com","http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release.do?id=1380209&sourceType=3","Marketwire - Breaking News Releases","TSX:EXN","","Excellon Announces Final 2010 Assays From the High-Grade Pierna Manto and Provides an Exploration Update 727 g/t (21 oz/T) Ag, 8.38% Pb, 17.06% Zn Over 10.76 m in Hole EX10-LP884 Excellon Resources Inc. (TSX:EXN) is pleased to announce assays for the final two 2010 massive sulphide intersections in the Pierna Manto. Hole LP884 intersected 10.76 metres (m) of massive sulphides grading 727g/t (21 oz/T) Ag, 8.38% Pb, 17.06% Zn. Hole LP883 intersected 4.61 m grading 709 g/t (21 oz/T) Ag, 8.69% Pb, 15.12% Zn. The Pierna Manto was discovered in October 2010 and lies between the Rodilla and NE-1 Mantos. There are now eight holes with significant sulphide intersections in Pierna and it remains open to the northwest along a significant northwest-southeast trending structure that has not been fully defined. Additional drilling is planned for early 2011. In other exploration news: The Company received preliminary results from the Geotech ZTEM airborne geophysical survey in mid-December. ZTEM data require sophisticated interpretation, which is underway, and we expect to have interpreted results to begin ground-truthing in February. This relatively new type of survey has depth penetration beyond that of most airborne systems and is particularly effective at detecting structures at depth. Structural networks are fundamental controls on the style of Carbonate Replacement Deposit (CRD) being exploited at Platosa and lead to their proximal source, which is the ultimate object of the Company's exploration. Early 2011 exploration will focus on the following three areas: The corridor between the 6A/6B Manto and the Rincon del Caido area 1.5 km to the northwest - Indications of a proximal environment where we might expect to find a large-tonnage deposit were found at Rincon del Caido in mid-2010 as were new massive sulphides leading northwest from 6A/6B. Holes LP773 intersected 3.11 m grading 817 g/t (24 oz/T) Ag, 12.41% Pb, 5.01% Zn while hole LP830 intersected 931 g/t (27 oz/T) Ag, 9.36% Pb, 6.54% Zn over 3.70 m. These intersections were amongst 23 reported from the 6A/6B Manto extension in six Company press releases between May 25 th and November 4th, 2010. The area between Rincon del Caido and the 6A/6B Manto is considered to hold very high potential; The Pierna Manto area - As noted above the surrounding area is largely open for immediate massive sulphide discovery, but perhaps more importantly, Pierna may also lead towards Rincon del Caido; and 3D IP anomalies outlined and drilled in late 2010 were explained by pyrite-rich hornfels. While no values were found it is encouraging that significant amounts of sulphides were intersected. Additional drilling and further review of the 3D IP data, taking into account these drilling results, will be carried out early in the year. Portions of these priority areas are shown on Map 3 below. Drilling resumed with one rig starting in the Rincon-6A/6B corridor January 10 th when drill crews returned from the Holiday break. As drilling progresses we will evaluate adding a 2 nd drill. ""We are very pleased by the growth of the new high-grade Pierna Manto; this almost immediately impacts future production planning and again demonstrates Platosa's high discovery potential,"" said John Sullivan, Excellon's Vice-President of Exploration. ""We are also anxious to get to work with the interpreted results of our ZTEM survey, which we expect to be a great help in advancing our exploration, not only for the proximal source of the mantos, but over our entire property. We more than doubled our land holdings to almost 58,000 ha (143,300 acres) during 2010 and we expect the airborne results to help jump start exploration of the new ground since most is overburden covered and has seen little previous exploration."" Assay details for holes LP883 and LP884 are shown in the Table and on Map 2 below. All intervals are estimated true thicknesses. In addition to these two holes there have been six other holes drilled at Platosa since the exploration press release dated November 17, 2010. While none intersected significant values they have added considerably to our knowledge base and will be valuable in planning future programs. Excellon's drill core samples are prepared and assayed by SGS Minerals Services (SGS) in Durango, Mexico. The lab is accredited to ISO/IEC 17025. The Company has a comprehensive QAQC program, supervised by an independent Qualified Person. Qualified Persons The Company's exploration programs are supervised by John Sullivan, Excellon's Vice-President of exploration, in consultation with Dr. Peter Megaw of IMDEX Inc.

Yolette Etienne speaks with young survivors days after the earthquake destroyed much of Port-au-Prince. Photo by Liz Lucas/Oxfam America I met Yolette Etienne about a year ago in the midst of chaos and sorrow. It was less than two weeks after the earthquake had turned Haiti's capital into a sea of dust and ruin, killing more than 220,000 people-Yolette's mother among them. Still, Yolette came to work each day at Oxfam through the snarl of traffic backed up behind the rubble, reminders of all that was lost at every turn, a heartbreaking beginning to days that seemed to have no end. How did she manage? I don't know. But she did, with a warmth I felt instantly, even though I was a stranger and had arrived at a terrible time. And when I asked about going to church, it was Yolette who said, yes! Let's go. It was a Sunday and strangely still, the air heavy with people longing for normalcy. I thought they might find it in church, with prayer, with song. Yolette borrowed a truck and we set out through the moonscape of Port-au-Prince in search of a service. She knew the roads by heart, and the shortcuts, too-even without the landmarks that had once defined the neighborhoods. We stopped at Eglise de la Communauté Evangelique D'Haiti: its doors were open wide and parishioners packed just about every seat. Yolette let me out-and with a flash of a smile, she was gone. A few weeks ago, I met Yolette again, this time as a colleague with whom I'll be working even more closely: She is now the director of Oxfam America's new program in Haiti. I was back in the country to report on the work Oxfam had undertaken since the quake-the more than 500,000 survivors it has helped with water and sanitation, shelter and jobs, and the 700,000 others it is reaching with a massive program to stem the spread of cholera that has now swept into every province. Her smile? It was still same, but this time she embraced me-and a deep conversation followed about the hardships Haitians have endured these many months since the quake, and the patience and hard work all must summon for the long road ahead. © 2011 Oxfam America Inc.

According to the USDA, about a third of children 6 to 19 years old are overweight or obese, and the number of obese children has tripled in the past few decades. ""The United States is facing an obesity epidemic and the crisis of poor diets threatens the future of our children and our nation,"" explained Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""If we don't contain obesity in this country it's going to eat us alive in terms of health care costs."" The first major government attempt to overhaul student meals in 15 years includes dishing up more whole grains, fruits and vegetables. If French fries are on your school menu everyday, there's going to be a problem. The new guidelines limit kids to only one cup of starchy vegetables a week and schools would be required to cut sodium in meals by more than half, but they have 10 years to gradually bring the salt content down. Cafeterias would also use more whole grains and serve low-fat milk. According to experts, lunchtime is a great opportunity for children to get some of their daily dose of fruits and vegetables. School aged children need 1 ½ to 2 cups of fruit and 1 ½ to 3 cups of vegetables, depending on the age and gender of the child. The Agriculture Department proposal applies to lunches subsidized by the federal government. The subsidized meals are served as free and low-cost meals to low-income children and long have been subject to government nutrition standards. The new law for the first time will also extend nutrition standards to other foods sold in schools that aren't subsidized by the federal government, including ""a la carte"" foods on the lunch line and snacks in vending machines. Those standards, while expected to be similar, will be written separately. With many kids consuming as much as half of their daily calories in school and the new guidelines affecting more than 32 million American children, the new standards could have a far reaching impact. The new USDA guidelines would: - Establish the first calorie limits for school meals. - Gradually reduce the amount of sodium in the meals over 10 years, with the eventual goal of reducing sodium by more than half. - Ban most trans fats . - Require more servings of fruits and vegetables . - Require all milk served to be low fat or nonfat, and require all flavored milks to be nonfat . - Incrementally increase the amount of whole grains required, eventually requiring most grains to be whole grains . - Improve school breakfasts by requiring schools to serve a grain and a protein, instead of one or the other . The proposed nutritional rules are based on the Institute of Medicine guidelines that were released in October 2009. But keep in mind, the new guidelines are an Agriculture Department proposal, and it could be several years before schools would be"

The federal lawsuit says the league missed the initial deadline for repayment in October and another on Dec. 1. The suit, filed Monday, names as defendants league co-founder William Hambrecht and his revocable trust, which guaranteed the loan. Calls to the league's legal and public relations offices by The Associated Press Thursday weren't immediately returned. Cuban declined additional comment when contacted by the AP. Cuban's loan coincided with an announcement by the league last April that he would be an investor.

The Canadian-born Black, a member of Britain's House of Lords, was released from prison on bail in July after serving nearly 2 1/2 years of his 6 1/2-year sentence.

Crowton has been with LSU four seasons, starting in 2007, when the Tigers won a national title. LSU coach Les Miles announced Crowton's resignation Thursday. Edsall was hired as Maryland's coach this month. He and Crowton worked together at Boston College. LSU has gone 40-13 during Crowton's time with the Tigers but ranked last in the Southeastern Conference in passing in 2010.

But as Suzanne Collins reports the proposed budget could mean larger class sizes. In the Baltimore County schools proposed budget, there could be one or two more children in a classroom. But that won't happen in kindergarten, first or second grades. There will also be less money for school supplies and equipment. The Teachers Union is concerned. ""As far as paper, batteries for equipment they use, or computer ware,"" said Cheryl Bost, Teacher Association of Baltimore County. ""We want to make sure some of those things are preserved so we can give the best instruction."" Even though there are big cuts, this budget proposal is still $6.5 million more than last year's. The reason for that is the school system expects to get about 900 more students in the fall. The superintendent's budget means 196 less teaching positions. Vacancies won't be filled or retiring teachers replaced. School headquarters cut its budget by 5 percent, and the money given to each individual school will be reduced by the same amount. Parents say somehow creative teachers will still educate children. ""I think they love their classrooms, and they have amazing teachers who create incredible environments, and I don't think any of that is going to change,"" said Yara Cheikh, Hampton Elementary PTA. ""I think it's going to be more of a challenge for teachers."" The school system says cuts won't affect security at schools or maintenance. Special education, science and technology and at-risk programs will remain untouched, as will teacher salaries and benefits. ""We've managed to avoid any kind of furlough or layoffs, we're talking about making sure those teachers are compensated,"" Bost said."

There's a way to fast- forward the process if time isn't on your side. Ana Padilla and her family are now first time homeowners after they went through the rapid rescore process. ""There's going to be a little countertop here with some stools here,"" Padilla pointed out the works she plans to do on the home. The current remodeling project is a breeze compared to the rejection she received a year ago when she was putting offers down on homes. Her 640 FICO score just wasn't where it needed to be. ""We were anxious, excited, but at the same time we kind of saw like this is going to have to wait. Probably by the time we're ready that house is not going to be there no more."" The house Ana had her eye on was a short sale. She was introduced to Mayra Torres, a lender who felt a better loan would improve Ana's chances of getting her offers accepted. She just needed to pay down her debt fast! ""She had a lot of student loans because she had just graduated and got her nursing degrees. So we needed to get her FICO scores higher to a 680 and we also needed her to be able to decrease her expenses,"" explained Torres. Ana was able to pay down the debt but normally it takes 30 to 45 days to update your credit score information with the credit bureaus. What she needed was a rapid rescore - a way of fast forwarding a credit score update within 72 hours. The borrower provides the lender with proof that he or she has paid down the debt. The lender hires and hands over that proof to a third party credit agency. That credit agency goes directly to the three credit bureaus to update the borrowers improved credit score within days compared to weeks. ""Usually what happens is when you need a rapid rescore, it's when you have an offer accepted and we need to move and we need it now. So that's when rapid rescore comes into play,"" added real estate agent Josie Andrade. She said not all agents have the patience to take on clients who need to improve FICO scores or run rapid rescores. It can be tedious and time consuming. ""If this is really what they want, if they want to take on that American dream, this is where we need to start,"" Torres said. Ana was able to raise her score 30 points and now she's thrilled to be a homeowner ""The sacrifice is well worth it,"" she said. Typically if you are a good candidate for a rapid rescore there is no cost to you."

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (left) and Rep. Gabrielle Giffords developed a friendship while working in the U.S. House. (Source: Debbie Wasserman Schultz) TUCSON, AZ (CBS4) - A South Florida Congresswoman said it was nothing short of a miracle as she watched U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords open her eyes for the first time after being shot over the weekend. ""It felt like we were watching a miracle,"" said U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz. ""The strength that you could see flowing out of her, it was like she was trying to will her eyes open."" Wasserman Schultz, who's from Weston, was in Giffords' hospital room with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-NY. Both women, who are close friends of Giffords, traveled to Arizona with President Barack Obama aboard Air Force One. The three women became close friends while they were all serving in the House. Giffords and her husband would often go on double-dates with Gillibrand and take summer vacations to New Hampshire with Wasserman Schultz's family. Wasserman Schultz said they were sharing these memories with Giffords when she signaled that she knew they were there. Gillibrand was holding Giffords' left hand when she said she started to feel it move and then squeeze her hand. Then Giffords' right eye started to flicker. (Her left eye, damaged in the shooting, is bandaged.) For about 30 seconds, Giffords struggled, before finally opening her eye wide and straining to focus on her friends, husband, parents and doctor. ""We knew she could hear and understand what we were saying,"" Gillibrand told reporters traveling back to Washington with the president Thursday morning. Giffords' husband Mark Kelly then told his wife to give them a thumbs-up if she could hear him. Instead, she slowly raised her left arm. ""The doctor said this is amazing what she's doing right now and beyond our greatest hopes,"" Gillibrand said. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama had visited with Giffords and her husband earlier in the day before attending a memorial service for the victims of Saturday's shooting rampage. Kelly told the president and first lady about the development as they drove from the hospital to the University of Arizona's McKale Center for the memorial service and gave Mr. Obama permission to tell the crowd about his wife's progress. ""Gabby opened her eyes,"" Obama told the cheering crowd. ""So I can tell you: She knows we are here, she knows we love her, and she knows that we are rooting for her through what is undoubtedly going to be a difficult journey."""
