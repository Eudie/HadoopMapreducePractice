For personal reasons my mother wants to sign her house over to my fiancé and I, she will then rent a smaller place. As she is signing the house over to us we won't have to pay a deposit or anything. All that is left on her mortgage is £18'000. In order for us to own the house we would need to find a mortgage to cover the £18'000 so that her mortgage could be paid off. My fiancé and I are on approx. £24'000 a year between us before tax and deductions. However the help we receive from student finance is not counted when applying for a mortgage. Therefore we only earn approx. £13'000 between us after tax and deductions. Does anyone know of a mortgage provider of mortgage scheme that would allow us to take out an £18'000 mortgage on this sort of income.

And how many still haven't changed their minds... I need some probability. BY THE WAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO READ THIS WHOLE THING... Just background information on why I'm asking. My boyfriend and I have only been together 5 months... so it's early enough that I won't completely ruin my life by ending it if I really need to. We haven't said 'I love you'... he says he's not ready yet... But I think I am... I just want him to say it first. The problem with us is I really don't want kids...but he is completely set on having kids, he says it's in his heart and that he's always wanted to be a dad... and he's the type that won't change for anybody (that in itself may be reason enough to break up, maybe he just doesn't care about being with me that much, and maybe he would change for someone else). I care about him more than anything. He's my best friend. But I don't want to ruin my life because I stay with him and then either end up having kids to make him happy and make myself unhappy OR have my heart ripped out because I'm not willing to have kids just to stay with him and then be all alone. And I could also miss the chance to find the right guy for me that I want to be with just as much but will want the same things as me. Right now, I just feel like my boyfriend is the one I want to be with. And just so everyone knows, I have never been the type to throw around 'I love you' like a 12 year old or say that I was going to be with a guy forever. I have never told a guy I loved him and I had always felt like I would never want to tell a guy that I loved him. I used to say I would never get married. But now I know I do, and I hope it is my boyfriend... I know that a lot of women change their mind about kids later on in life. I was hoping that would kind of be what would happen for me... And I'm only 18, so I think it's definitely a possibility that I could change my mind... But the fact that I'm thinking about changing my mind makes me kind of sick. Like I said I'm only 18. I'm really young, too young to be thinking about having kids. So I'm still really kind of selfish and I care a lot about the way I look. Before I was old enough to take care of myself and buy my own things, I was having to share and always kind of be unselfish because I grew up with ten other siblings. And I also know that I don't want to be fat because I have kids. Just being big while being pregnant would make me really depressed. And I'm also REALLY scared of the actual birth part. I don't want my private part to be all stretched out because when I'm married, I want to have sex and I want it to feel good for both of us even after I have kids IF I decide to. It would make me a lot less against having kids if babies didn't come out down there. I don't want to have to deal with dirty diapers, snotty noses, and throw up. Which is weird because I was a nanny for a year and was pretty dang good at it. I have no problems with kids or babies... just never wanted one of my own or have to deal with all the things that come with it. The point is, I just want to stay with my boyfriend. And unlike him, I'm willing to try and change. Which is probably really stupid. But I am, and I want to know what the chances are that I will change my mind. And I also want to know what the chances are that I will NEVER change my mind. So basically my situation completely sucks... And you must be really bored if you read this whole thing. en Español Yahoo!Xtra does not evaluate or guarantee the accuracy of any Yahoo!Xtra Answers content."

According to the USDA, about a third of children 6 to 19 years old are overweight or obese, and the number of obese children has tripled in the past few decades. ""The United States is facing an obesity epidemic and the crisis of poor diets threatens the future of our children and our nation,"" explained Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. ""If we don't contain obesity in this country it's going to eat us alive in terms of health care costs."" The first major government attempt to overhaul student meals in 15 years includes dishing up more whole grains, fruits and vegetables. If French fries are on your school menu everyday, there's going to be a problem. The new guidelines limit kids to only one cup of starchy vegetables a week and schools would be required to cut sodium in meals by more than half, but they have 10 years to gradually bring the salt content down. Cafeterias would also use more whole grains and serve low-fat milk. According to experts, lunchtime is a great opportunity for children to get some of their daily dose of fruits and vegetables. School aged children need 1 ½ to 2 cups of fruit and 1 ½ to 3 cups of vegetables, depending on the age and gender of the child. The Agriculture Department proposal applies to lunches subsidized by the federal government. The subsidized meals are served as free and low-cost meals to low-income children and long have been subject to government nutrition standards. The new law for the first time will also extend nutrition standards to other foods sold in schools that aren't subsidized by the federal government, including ""a la carte"" foods on the lunch line and snacks in vending machines. Those standards, while expected to be similar, will be written separately. With many kids consuming as much as half of their daily calories in school and the new guidelines affecting more than 32 million American children, the new standards could have a far reaching impact. The new USDA guidelines would: - Establish the first calorie limits for school meals. - Gradually reduce the amount of sodium in the meals over 10 years, with the eventual goal of reducing sodium by more than half. - Ban most trans fats . - Require more servings of fruits and vegetables . - Require all milk served to be low fat or nonfat, and require all flavored milks to be nonfat . - Incrementally increase the amount of whole grains required, eventually requiring most grains to be whole grains . - Improve school breakfasts by requiring schools to serve a grain and a protein, instead of one or the other . The proposed nutritional rules are based on the Institute of Medicine guidelines that were released in October 2009. But keep in mind, the new guidelines are an Agriculture Department proposal, and it could be several years before schools would be"

The environment ministry's no-go classification prohibits mining activity in heavily forested areas, classified as no-go, to conserve ecology. Around 203 blocks in nine coalfields have fallen in the no-go regions, threatening major infrastructure projects. While members of the GoM were yet to be decided, it should not take more than a month for the group to come up with its recommendations, Jaiswal said. ""At least the environment and the coal ministers will be there in the GoM. In the first meeting of the GoM, I will ask for a quicker solution to the problem, as one year has already passed since the issue cropped up, and, the coal production shortfall is increasing,"" he added. The coal ministry had recently floated a Cabinet note on the issue, asking for freeing of at least 90 per cent of the blocks and offering a three times higher afforestation effort by mining companies to conserve forests.

"","Continued rise of crude oil price a growing worry","2011-01-13T19:53:35Z","2011-01-13T19:53:35Z","business-standard.com","http://business-standard.com/common/storypage_c.php?leftnm=10&autono=421782","","","","Continued rise of crude oil price a growing worry As policymakers struggle to combat rising food inflation, the country is faced with another big concern, of crude oil touching a 27-month high of $95.26 per barrel. The stocks of oil marketing companies (OMCs) took a beating today. At the Bombay Stock Exchange, Indian Oil lost 2.76 per cent to close at a monthly low of Rs 310.60, Bharat Petroleum lost 3.25 per cent to close at Rs 597.80 and Hindustan Petroleum lost 5.15 per cent to close at Rs 362.70, after touching a monthly low of Rs 359.55. All three companies are scheduled to declare their December quarter results in the last week of January. Analysts expect all of them to report losses. ""This is an extremely worrisome situation for the domestic economy, the industry and consumers. This is a cause for concern for a company like ours, as the cost of oilfield services also moves up and this offsets the increase in realisation. I apprehend the rally may not halt here,"" said R S Sharma, chairman and managing director, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the country's biggest energy explorer. Its share price, however, gained 1.04 per cent to Rs 1,199.30. The OMCs, which purchase crude oil at market rates, are required to sell diesel, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (cooking gas) at government-set prices, resulting in losses. These are usually compensated by a cash subsidy from the government and discounts on crude purchase from the upstream companies, ONGC and Oil India Ltd. Diesel, kerosene and LPG together account for 60 per cent of the consumption of petroleum products. Their price has not been increased since June 25. Currently, the three OMCs are incurring under-recovery (revenue loss) of Rs 7 per litre on diesel, Rs 19.60 per litre on kerosene and Rs 366 per cylinder on domestic LPG. These losses would increase when data based on the current fortnight's average is compiled this weekend. The two private sector retailers, Reliance and Essar Oil, have increased diesel prices. Petrol prices were decontrolled from June 26, 2010, and the OMCs have raised these every now and then to pass on the loss.

The full report of an experts' committee headed by Rangarajan on food security - which was a critique of the NAC proposals - was released today. The report says sharply focusing on and finetuning the Public Distribution System (PDS) continues to be an answer to food security. It implies making the changes envisaged by NAC involves a leap of faith and ability that India might not be ready for. The report praises the Chhattisgarh government's initiative in reforming PDS. Chhattisgarh is run by the Bharatiya Janata Party. The committee does not commend any Congress-ruled state for PDS reform, except Haryana (which is given credit for implementing smart cards for PDS beneficiaries) and Delhi. It also supported Tamil Nadu for experimenting with PDS management through a Global Positioning System (GPS), Gujarat for using bar-coded grain bags and Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for introducing SMS alert systems. All these states are ruled by non-Congress governments. The report says the total subsidy outgo is expected to be higher than the NAC projections on account of a number of factors. It says according to NAC projections, the total subsidy will work out to Rs 71,837 crore in the first phase (during which 72 per cent of the population will be targeted) and Rs 79,931 crore in the final phase (during which 75 per cent of the population will be targeted). But Rangarajan says this figure needs to be revised upwards if October 2011 and 2013 projections for the two phases are extrapolated and a 100 per cent offtake is assumed. He says subsidy then increases to Rs 85,584 crore and Rs 92,060 crore respectively. Besides this, the current procurement and storage capacity of a little above 42.5 million tonnes, providing 68.76 million tonnes of foodgrain in the first phase and 73.98 million tonnes in the final phase, implies significant scaling up of the procurement, warehousing and supply chain operations. This involves large financial outgo which has not been quantified. The report also points out that since the promised entitlements are legally enforceable, procurement will need to be scaled up by large increases in the minimum support price or imports. ""Both options imply a large fiscal burden difficult to quantify,"" the repeort says. Admitting the NAC's thinking is correct, Rangarajan says as the right to food security will become legally tenable, India must be aware of its effects. FOOD FOR THOUGHT (Broad suggestions) # Total foodgrain requirement for priority households, buffer stock and other welfare programmes are estimated to be 50.96 mt this year, while procurement is at 56.35 mt # The balance foodgrains of around 5 mt can be distributed to the non-entitled population (general households) at an issue price equal to minimum support price # The subsidy outgo for foodgrains for entitled households is estimated to be '83,000 crore, which includes the subsidy for welfare programmes and maintenance of buffer stock Giftwithlove.com: Order Online for Gift delivery in India starting Rs.289/ Follow the ups and downs of your investments.

Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said the government had taken steps to contain inflation and it would fall in coming weeks. ""We have analysed the situation. We have indicated that further steps we are going to take. We have also indicated that there should not be any panic"", said Mukherjee. When asked whether the government would be able to control inflation, Mukherjee replied: ""Of course, we will be able to."" Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council Chairman C Rangarajan also expressed hope that there would be some softening in food prices. ""I expect some softening of food prices in the coming weeks, coming months. There is normally a seasonal decline in these months (November and December) but, unfortunately, that was not seen,"" he said. The double-digit inflation rate also comes over a high base of 2010 when food inflation stood at 19.65 per cent. Given the recent spurt in prices, analysts are skeptical about a significant easing in prices, though the base effect is expected to dampen the rise and the government may take firm steps to curtail inflation in food articles. However, most expect a mild trend of moderation in the weeks ahead. Giftwithlove.com: Order Online for Gift delivery in India starting Rs.289/ Follow the ups and downs of your investments.

This would involve increasing the port handling capacity of the country to 3 billion tonnes from the existing 617 million tonnes along with various policy reforms in the shipping and ports sector, Shipping Minister G K Vasan said. The agenda will replace the National Maritime Development Programme, which was to end in 2012. The government also plans to set up a regulator to keep a vigil on port operations including setting, monitoring and regulating the service levels, as well as technical and performance standards. Currently, the Tariff Authority of Major Ports fixes the price ceiling. ""All the ports should be left free to fix their tariff, depending upon inter-play of market forces. The regulator can be entrusted with the responsibility of dispute resolution as appropriate,"" Vasan added. As part of the agenda, the shipping ministry will be drafting a coastal shipping policy and a transshipment policy to relax cabotage laws for promoting transshipment ports. Currently, work on the International Container Transshipment Terminal in Vallarpadam, Kochi is going on.

It says according to NAC projections, the total subsidy will work out to Rs 71,837 crore in the first phase (during which 72 per cent of the population will be targeted) and Rs 79,931 crore in the final phase (during which 75 per cent of the population will be targeted). But Rangarajan says this figure needs to be revised upwards if October 2011 and 2013 projections for the two phases are extrapolated and a 100 per cent offtake is assumed. He says subsidy then increases to Rs 85,584 crore and Rs 92,060 crore respectively. Besides this, the current procurement and storage capacity of a little above 42.5 million tonnes, providing 68.76 million tonnes of foodgrain in the first phase and 73.98 million tonnes in the final phase, implies significant scaling up of the procurement, warehousing and supply chain operations. This involves large financial outgo which has not been quantified. The report also points out that since the promised entitlements are legally enforceable, procurement will need to be scaled up by large increases in the minimum support price or imports. ""Both options imply a large fiscal burden difficult to quantify,"" the repeort says. Admitting the NAC's thinking is correct, Rangarajan says as the right to food security will become legally tenable, India must be aware of its effects. FOOD FOR THOUGHT (Broad suggestions) # Total foodgrain requirement for priority households, buffer stock and other welfare programmes are estimated to be 50.96 mt this year, while procurement is at 56.35 mt # The balance foodgrains of around 5 mt can be distributed to the non-entitled population (general households) at an issue price equal to minimum support price # The subsidy outgo for foodgrains for entitled households is estimated to be '83,000 crore, which includes the subsidy for welfare programmes and maintenance of buffer stock Giftwithlove.com: Order Online for Gift delivery in India starting Rs.289/ Follow the ups and downs of your investments.

The stocks of oil marketing companies (OMCs) took a beating today. At the Bombay Stock Exchange, Indian Oil lost 2.76 per cent to close at a monthly low of Rs 310.60, Bharat Petroleum lost 3.25 per cent to close at Rs 597.80 and Hindustan Petroleum lost 5.15 per cent to close at Rs 362.70, after touching a monthly low of Rs 359.55. All three companies are scheduled to declare their December quarter results in the last week of January. Analysts expect all of them to report losses. ""This is an extremely worrisome situation for the domestic economy, the industry and consumers.

I apprehend the rally may not halt here,"" said R S Sharma, chairman and managing director, Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), the country's biggest energy explorer. Its share price, however, gained 1.04 per cent to Rs 1,199.30. The OMCs, which purchase crude oil at market rates, are required to sell diesel, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (cooking gas) at government-set prices, resulting in losses. These are usually compensated by a cash subsidy from the government and discounts on crude purchase from the upstream companies, ONGC and Oil India Ltd. Diesel, kerosene and LPG together account for 60 per cent of the consumption of petroleum products. Their price has not been increased since June 25. Currently, the three OMCs are incurring under-recovery (revenue loss) of Rs 7 per litre on diesel, Rs 19.60 per litre on kerosene and Rs 366 per cylinder on domestic LPG. These losses would increase when data based on the current fortnight's average is compiled this weekend. The two private sector retailers, Reliance and Essar Oil, have increased diesel prices.

Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said the government had taken steps to contain inflation and it would fall in coming weeks. ""We have analysed the situation. We have indicated that further steps we are going to take. We have also indicated that there should not be any panic"", said Mukherjee. When asked whether the government would be able to control inflation, Mukherjee replied: ""Of course, we will be able to."" Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council Chairman C Rangarajan also expressed hope that there would be some softening in food prices. ""I expect some softening of food prices in the coming weeks, coming months. There is normally a seasonal decline in these months (November and December) but, unfortunately, that was not seen,"" he said. The double-digit inflation rate also comes over a high base of 2010 when food inflation stood at 19.65 per cent. Given the recent spurt in prices, analysts are skeptical about a significant easing in prices, though the base effect is expected to dampen the rise and the government may take firm steps to curtail inflation in food articles. However, most expect a mild trend of moderation in the weeks ahead. Giftwithlove.com: Order Online for Gift delivery in India starting Rs.289/ Follow the ups and downs of your investments.

The full report of an experts' committee headed by Rangarajan on food security - which was a critique of the NAC proposals - was released today. The report says sharply focusing on and finetuning the Public Distribution System (PDS) continues to be an answer to food security. It implies making the changes envisaged by NAC involves a leap of faith and ability that India might not be ready for. The report praises the Chhattisgarh government's initiative in reforming PDS. Chhattisgarh is run by the Bharatiya Janata Party. The committee does not commend any Congress-ruled state for PDS reform, except Haryana (which is given credit for implementing smart cards for PDS beneficiaries) and Delhi. It also supported Tamil Nadu for experimenting with PDS management through a Global Positioning System (GPS), Gujarat for using bar-coded grain bags and Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for introducing SMS alert systems. All these states are ruled by non-Congress governments. The report says the total subsidy outgo is expected to be higher than the NAC projections on account of a number of factors. It says according to NAC projections, the total subsidy will work out to Rs 71,837 crore in the first phase (during which 72 per cent of the population will be targeted) and Rs 79,931 crore in the final phase (during which 75 per cent of the population will be targeted).

"Prescriptions","Study Finds Lack of Disclosure Among Advocacy Groups","2011-01-13T21:03:31Z","2011-01-13T21:03:31Z","prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com","http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/13/study-finds-lack-of-disclosure-among-advocacy-groups/","Making Sense of the Health Care Debate","Drug Industry:doctors:health care law:advocacy:Eli Lilly:financial disclosure:health groups","By DUFF WILSON","Some health advocacy groups that say they are speaking for patients' interests before legislatures, regulatory agencies or public forums fail to disclose their funding from drug makers, a new study from Columbia University says. The study compared the drug maker Eli Lilly's disclosures of $3.2 million in payments to 161 health advocacy groups in the first half of 2007 with the groups' own disclosures. Only one-quarter of the groups acknowledged Lilly's support anywhere on their public Web sites, the study said. Only 1 in 10 disclosed Lilly as the sponsor of a specific grant, and none of them disclosed the exact amount. The Columbia researchers recommended expansion of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act enacted by Congress last year to require drug and medical device companies to report those payments. They also called for new federal tax regulations to require the non-profit health advocacy groups to list industry donors and sums on their tax returns. In response, Senator Max Baucus, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican who co-sponsored the physician disclosure law with Senator Baucus, said in separate statements that they would consider the suggestions to increase transparency. Senator Baucus of Montana said in a statement that he would like to ""build on"" the new law that requires disclosure of payments to doctors and teaching hospitals starting in 2013. It was adopted as part of the health care overhaul. Mr. Grassley's press secretary, Jill Kozeny, said the senator was open to recommendations to expand the disclosure requirements to prescribers, patient organizations, professional societies, group purchasing organizations and pharmacy benefit managers. Doctors are being asked to disclose far more about their financial connections to industry than the health advocacy groups that exercise broad lobbying and public relations powers, said Sheila M. Rothman, a professor of public health at Columbia and lead author of the study. ""I'm not saying it's wrong, just that it should be disclosed,"" Professor Rothman said in an interview. ""There is no way at this point that you can follow the money as a citizen, a health care provider or as a legislator or regulator."" Lilly's reports were studied because it was the first company to disclose such payments. In 2009, the Indianapolis drug maker said in a statement: ""We regularly publish U.S. grant funding on line and encourage advocacy organizations to consider their own transparency efforts."" Some other companies have also begun to disclose the payments, sometimes in response to federal investigations. Professor Rothman said it was especially important for advocacy groups to disclose industry funding when they testify or speak with legislators or the media or serve on advisory panels. Some organizations have said their competitors would pirate their funding organizations if they disclosed them, she added, and some legislators have wondered if they really want to impose such disclosure requirements on constituents who testify or lobby on behalf of patients. But Professor Rothman said it was necessary to disclose the funding because the groups say they represent patients, not marketing interests, and often seek public funding for their causes. ""Since they represent themselves as promoting the public interest, health advocacy organizations should disclose to their members, legislators, and the public where their money is coming from and what they are getting the money for,"" she said in a statement. Groups that failed to disclose the Lilly grants included the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and the National Breast Cancer Coalition Fund, lobbying powerhouses in two areas of top-selling Lilly drugs, the study said. Other groups were much smaller, and only one of the 161 in the study, a Pennsylvania mental health group, disclosed an approximate amount of its grant, which was $5,000, Professor Rothman said. The study was released in Thursday's Web edition of the American Journal of Public Health. Co-authors are Victoria H. Raveis, Anne Friedman, and David J. Rothman of Columbia University, who is Sheila Rothman's spouse and president of the Columbia-affiliated Institute on Medicine as a Profession."

The morning after an unsuccessful attempt by environmentalists to stop the project, splintered branches and trunks lay on the ground as back hoes ripped away at remnants of the grove in a now-vacant area bordered on two sides by still-standing lines of trees. ""They're pulling out the material that remains,"" Los Angeles County Public Works spokesman Bob Spencer said as a back hoe noisily dug up a tree stump a few feet away. ""It will be mulched right on site."" Two men, including veteran tree-sitter John Quigley, and two women were escorted out of the trees Wednesday night and taken into custody, Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. Julio Salcido said. They were booked on suspicion of delaying a peace officer and trespassing, he said. Spencer said sheriff's deputies using a cheery picker spoke directly to the four and persuaded them to come down. ""They went peacefully,"" Spencer said. ""They came down voluntarily and were handcuffed."" Earlier Wednesday, with the sounds of bulldozers echoing beneath him, Quigley perched in a century-old oak in the foothills above this Los Angeles suburb. ""They're destroying trees all around us,"" Quigley said by cell phone. ""It's a sad scene and definitely something that didn't need to happen."" Public works officials say the 11 acres of trees, some of them more than 100 years old, had to go to ensure the integrity of a nearby dam that is critical for flood control and also recharges aquifers that supply all the drinking water for the Los Angeles suburb of Sierra Madre and 75 percent for neighboring Arcadia. Shortly before Quigley and the others were arrested, about three dozen protesters, including actress Daryl Hannah, gathered at a gate leading to the area to hold a candlelight vigil. ""They don't need to tear down an eco system with trees over 100 years old,"" said Hannah, who learned of the protest through Quigley. She added that dam sediment could have been hauled to gravel pits 10 miles away. Spencer said Thursday that public works officials had indeed looked into that possibility, but it would have required hauling 50,000 dump-truck loads of sediment through Arcadia, an upscale community of about 56,000 people. ""The city said no,"" he said. Public Works officials say the project is necessary to ensure that the Santa Anita Dam, built in 1927, meets seismic safety standards. Over the years, Spencer said, sediment has built up behind the dam, limiting its water capacity and compromising its safety in the event of an earthquake or other catastrophe. He said the area cleared of trees has been owned by the Public Works Department for 60 years and was bought specifically to be used as a sediment placement pit. There are already placement areas to the north and south of it, but the northern one is full and the southern one is nearing capacity. When the southern one is filled, public works officials plan to landscape several acres of it with oaks and other trees, and Spencer said environmentalists and local neighborhood organizations would be asked to help with that. ""We understand how sensitive this issue is,"" he said. ""We don't tear out environmental habitat willy nilly."" The now-decimated grove occupies a flatland below the steep slopes of the San Gabriel Mountains, about 20 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles. It is near a residential neighborhood and a small wilderness park in an area popular with weekend hikers and bicyclists. Several of the protesters who gathered Wednesday night said they had lived in the area for 40 or 50 years and walked their dogs there frequently. The clearing operation began after extensive efforts by opponents to stop it. In December, county officials ordered a 30-day moratorium, which ended last week. In 2003, Quigley spent 71 days in an oak tree known as Old Glory that was to be bulldozed to widen a street in Santa Clarita, another Los Angeles suburb. Authorities finally removed him from the tree, and it was saved and replanted elsewhere."

Try 2010. That was a pretty volatile year, if memory serves. But there's always somebody who ignores all of the good advice and goes against the odds. Such was the case of John Minnis, who launched Grosse Pointe Magazine last year, starting with a May/June 2010 issue. The local magazine, which is published six times a year and is hand-delivered for free to homes and business in the Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe, has enjoyed steadily rising advertising. Its January/February 2011 issue is its second-best to date in ad revenue, according to Minnis, editor and publisher of GPM. Minnis is not necessarily an impulsive gambler by nature. It was the tough publishing climate itself that motivated him to launch GPM. ""I'm a newspaper guy, and my newspaper got sold and I got laid off,"" he says. ""I decided to create my own job. There was a void in the market-there wasn't anything strictly local serving Grosse Pointe residents and businesses."" He hit a serious barrier to entry as he planned the launch-the cost of designing a prototype. Local graphics companies quoted prices that he just couldn't meet, and then Minnis recalled having met at a trade show in 2008 representatives from 2adpro, which provides fast turnaround and competitively priced advertising design and production services. The key with 2adpro, which has headquarters in Woodland Hills, Calif., and Bangalore, India, is that it has several hundred designers based in India who essentially are awake and working while we're asleep on this side of the planet. In Minnis' case, it was the cost savings in particular that enabled him to get his magazine off the ground. ""I dug out the 2adpro business card, and they quoted doing a 20-page prototype, and it was a quarter of the cost of using someone locally,"" Minnis says. ""They did it in InDesign in about two weeks. Just a little bit of tweaking on my own and I got about 50 copies made, and that got me started."" Minnis adapted the prototype for his magazine templates, and is handling InDesign layout himself, with 2adpro doing his ad building for clients and special layouts that need to be done quickly. ""The nice thing is we can present full graphics services to our clients, and 2adpro is transparent to them-they just know that we have this graphics capability,"" Minnis says. ""And it makes me appear bigger than I am."" A strictly local magazine launched successfully in the worst economic climate since the 1930s by a newspaper cast-off, with support from a team of designers in India. It's modern-day success story. min's Sales Executive of the Year Awards Saluting Sales Excellence at Media Companies Entry Deadline: March 11, 2011"

Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee said the government had taken steps to contain inflation and it would fall in coming weeks. ""We have analysed the situation. We have indicated that further steps we are going to take. We have also indicated that there should not be any panic"", said Mukherjee. When asked whether the government would be able to control inflation, Mukherjee replied: ""Of course, we will be able to."" Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council Chairman C Rangarajan also expressed hope that there would be some softening in food prices. ""I expect some softening of food prices in the coming weeks, coming months. There is normally a seasonal decline in these months (November and December) but, unfortunately, that was not seen,"" he said. The double-digit inflation rate also comes over a high base of 2010 when food inflation stood at 19.65 per cent. Given the recent spurt in prices, analysts are skeptical about a significant easing in prices, though the base effect is expected to dampen the rise and the government may take firm steps to curtail inflation in food articles. However, most expect a mild trend of moderation in the weeks ahead. Giftwithlove.com: Order Online for Gift delivery in India starting Rs.289/ Follow the ups and downs of your investments.

New Zealand, world, sport, business & entertainment news on Stuff.co.nz.","","Fleur Cogle","Parents happy saga at an end A Temuka couple who lost their son in the Pike River tragedy have welcomed a decision to stop efforts to recover the remains of the 29 miners killed in the November mine explosion. Christine and Rod Holling were not surprised by yesterday's announcement the police were ending the recovery phase of the rescue operation, and handing the mine to the receivers. Their son, Richard Bennett Holling, 41, was one of the 29 working in the mine on November 19. Mrs Holling said they expected the news when they received a text on Wednesday to say an announcement was to be made. ""We guessed this was coming some time ago and we are quite happy. We always said that that is the place where we would like our son to be."" She hoped the mine would be sealed and a memorial put in place for the miners. Police commissioner Howard Broad briefed families yesterday before making the announcement public. Mr Broad said he had consulted experts in Australia and New Zealand and the assessment was that there was little likelihood of entering the mine safely. Since the explosion temperatures and methane levels have continued to fluctuate in the mine, preventing the recovery of the miners' bodies. ""While it is possible to argue a technical case that access to the mine is possible, it is in my view, impractical to expend much hope on that prospect,"" Mr Broad said. The mine will be handed to Pike River Coal's receiver, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which took control in December. ""A key responsibility for the receivers will be securing the mine safely while it determines its next steps in its course of action,"" Mr Broad said. ""In my view it is time to focus on the living and respect and memorialise those men who have died."" Mrs Holling praised the efforts of the police, Pike River Coal and chief executive Peter Whittall, and said she had nothing negative to say about the way the recovery operation was carried out. ""I don't blame them. All miners that have mined over the years, they know the risks."" Prime Minister John Key last night said he had been told everything that could be done to recover the miners' bodies had been done. ""My thoughts are with the families of those who died at Pike River. But it has come to the point where no more can be achieved,"" he said. Labour leader Phil Goff said the decision would be heart-breaking for the families. ""It prevents the sort of closure that they'd hoped for. To be able to bury remains in whatever form they might now exist does help families with closure, and they will sadly now be denied that,"" Goff said. Ad Feedback Not being able to enter the mine would also be frustrating because it would make it more difficult to establish what had happened, he said, but Mr Broad's decision as police commissioner had to be accepted."

New Zealand, world, sport, business & entertainment news on Stuff.co.nz.","","Fleur Cogle","Timaru property values in dumps Gloom is yet to lift from the Timaru real estate market, with greater property value declines than the national trend. Figures released by Quotable Value (QV) yesterday show NZ residential properties continued a gradual decline in December and values were 0.9 per cent below the same time in 2009, and 5.8 per cent below the market peak of late 2007. However, the figures also showed property values in Timaru were 4 per cent below the same time in 2009. The average price of a house in Timaru last year was $241,539. According to the realestate.co.nz website, there are 557 listings including townhouses, houses, apartments, units, home and income properties. Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) South Canterbury spokesman Warwick Jones said it would be crystal ball-gazing to say if the decline would continue or if prices would level off. However, he said he had heard of some agents taking houses off the market and waiting for the situation to improve. They could be waiting a long time, he said. While the number of houses available was comparable to last year, there were fewer buyers and they were investigating the market carefully. Not all the news was gloomy. Unusually, buyers remained active right up until Christmas, and there had been some interest in January, he said. Interest had come from some Christchurch residents unsettled by the September 4 earthquake and the subsequent Boxing Day aftershock; however, those looking to move faced problems selling. Professionals real estate agent Carl Slade, who produces the Timaru Property Report, said despite some differences between QV figures and REINZ figures, the overall trend showed a decline. However, December figures showed the increase in buyer interest. The volume of house sales rose from 38 in November to 47 in December. Over the year the average number of sales a month in Timaru was 39.5. ""To put that into perspective, the average number of sales per month for the previous 15 years was 62 sales."" The increase in buyer interest was encouraging. ""Really, what we are hoping, is the volume of sales to increase. What we would call a normal market volume is about 60 [sales per month]."" An increase in buyers would increase the volume of sales which could bring prices back up, he said. Ad Feedback"

Rich shoppers have recovered far more quickly from the recession than middle and lower income consumers, and are hitting stores in droves to snap up cashmere sweaters, designer dresses and diamond necklaces at stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. Executives expect U.S. luxury sales to continue improving as the economy recovery trickles down to the middle class, particularly as so-called ""aspirational"" shoppers -- consumers who have fancy tastes but cannot afford the most expensive items -- feel more confident. ""The aspirational shopper is coming back, because they like brands, but they're still just putting their foot back in the water,"" Saks Inc ( SKS.N) Chief Executive Steve Sadove said. LVMH.PA) were among the first companies after the financial crisis ebbed to see sales soar as the ultra rich pampered themselves again. Meanwhile, ""affordable luxury"" companies such as Polo Ralph Lauren ( RL.N) and leather good maker Coach Inc ( COH.N) also benefited as the upper middle class resumed spending. Polo Ralph Lauren shares hit an all-time high in December. The stock market rally in 2010, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average rise 11 percent, has helped woo middle of the road customers back to stores. ""A lot of the lost wealth has been restored,"" Ira Kalish, director of global economics at Deloitte, told Reuters. Store chains like Saks suffered through some dramatic declines during the economic crisis. But it and its peers are rebounding. In December, sales at Saks stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 11.8 percent. Rival department store operators Nordstrom Inc ( JWN.N) and Neiman Marcus Group [NMRCUS.UL] also reported strong gains. ""It's a different world than it was a year ago,"" Saks' Sadove told Reuters on the sidelines of the National Retail Federation conference. ""Consumers are tied to how they feel about the stock market, and the markets have held up well."" Upscale retailers have had the extra benefit of catering to a clientele willing and able to pay full price, unlike midde-of-the-road chains like J.C. Penney Co ( LIZ.N) Lucky Brands stores, which still have to watch their prices. We welcome comments that advance the story directly or with relevant tangential information.

Kelleher DETROIT, Jan 12 (Reuters) - The top executive of AutoNation Inc ( AN.N), the No. 1 U.S. car selling chain, said on Wednesday he expects the industry to sell ""around 11 million"" vehicles to retail customers in the United States in 2011. Speaking at the Automotive News World Congress, Mike Jackson said he expects overall industry sales, which include fleet sales, to reach 12.8 million units in the United States this year, up from 11.5 million in 2010. But stripping out sales to rental companies and other big fleets, Jackson said he thought sales to U.S. retail customers would be ""probably around 11 million"" units. Jackson said he expected overall sales to rebound to 15 million units in the United States within three to four years. One of the things holding them back currently, he said, was that lenders remain reluctant to finance would-be car buyers whose credit is less than perfect. He said that only about 10 percent of the subprime auto loan applications that buyers in his showrooms submit to lenders get approved, down from a 50 percent approval rate back before the credit crunch and recession.

The return on a potential LBO of Sara Lee could rise significantly if buyout firms bought the entire company and then sold its meat business to a strategic investor, as recently speculated in the media, the analysts said. JBS could pay about $4 billion for Sara Lee's meat division, they added. Private equity firms have pursued Sao Paulo-based JBS ( JBSS3.SA), the world's biggest beef processor by revenue, since reports about a potential bid for Sara Lee arose late last year, a source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Tuesday. [ID:nN11140686] ""We think if this were to happen, JBS could bid for Sara Lee's meat division, as such an acquisition would be more feasible in size ... and they would presumably not need to sell the coffee business afterward,"" wrote Merrill Lynch analysts Fernando Ferreira and Isabella Simonato in the report. Ferreira and Simonato's remarks come after DealReporter said on Wednesday that a group of buyout firms led by Apollo Global Management [APOLO.UL] could bid for Sara Lee as early as this week, with a price in the range of $18.75 to $19 a share. Spokespeople for JBS and Apollo declined to comment when sought out by Reuters. Sara Lee shares were up 10 cents to $18.28 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange dealings. Integrating JBS's U.S. unit and Sara Lee's coffee and meat processing business could create value by providing a home for the trimmings of JBS's cattle and pig slaughtering operations. The deal could also help JBS boost its presence in processed foods, making profit margins more stable. JBS could further gain by reducing its reliance on commodities and turning into a key supplier of meats to rival food processors. Sara Lee, which has a range of businesses that include beverages, coffee and retail units, is valued around $12.5 billion by a number of analysts. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts Bryan Spillane and Mariya Goub said in a separate report that if a group of buyout firms were able to acquire all of Sara Lee and then ""simultaneously sell the meat assets to a strategic buyer, the cash proceeds could potentially enable a private equity buyer to quickly recoup a portion"" of the money used for the purchase.

New Zealand, world, sport, business & entertainment news on Stuff.co.nz.","","Jeff Tollan","Firefighters face change to workload New Zealand firefighters are being called to more medical incidents and fewer fires than ever, a change dividing some brigades. The Fire Service says its role is evolving, from a fire-focused organisation to a fire, rescue and emergency service. Area commander for Mid and South Canterbury, Paul Henderson said fires were now only part of the job. ""Some of our volunteers will encounter more motor vehicle accidents than they ever will structural fires. The role of the Fire Service is changing and that's world-wide."" Some Southland fire brigades have recently expressed frustration at being turned out to more medical calls in recent years. In 2006-07, Southland's volunteer brigades responded to 84 medical call-outs where there was no ambulance or it was delayed. That looks set to double in 2010-11 with 84 call-outs already since July 1. One chief fire officer said he had joined to fight fires. ""If I, personally, wanted to do the medical side, I would have joined St John."" ""I was quite surprised when I saw that article,"" Mr Henderson said. ""There is more than just attending structural fires. It all adds to reducing the risk to the general population."" Fairlie chief fire officer Jim Irving said probably more than half their calls were to vehicle collisions, though his team had not been to a medical callout, or assist ambulance call at all last year. ""It hasn't really affected us at this stage, but I can see it's going to."" Even so, he said there were times when it made sense for a fire crew to be turned out to a medical call and said nobody in the brigade had a problem with that. The region's busiest brigade for medical calls was St Andrews, with 29 callouts last year. Chief fire officer Gordon Hardacre said the town's firefighters carried first aid equipment and a defribulator in their fire engine. ""It's part of the job, it is exactly part of what goes on. It is fire rescue service, rather than a fire service."" When he first joined the Fire Service 51 years ago, fires were all crews attended. Helping people with medical treatment ""is what we're there for"". Fire Service communications manager Scott Sargentina said there was a partnership between the service, St John and other ambulance providers. ""[We] provide assistance when an ambulance is not readily available or at another call."" He said every firefighter had ""rudimentary"" first aid skills and could assist ""as a very low level in stablilising patients until an ambulance service arrives"". St John regional operations manager Chris Haines said since 2005 there was an agreement that the Fire Service would co-respond, or respond in advance of, ambulance services to ""selected accident or medical emergencies"" where a difference to patient outcomes could be made. Ad Feedback ""Some brigades have, with the approval of their management, received higher levels of first aid training from St John and are able to provide higher levels of clinical care than basic first aid."" Mr Haines said one example was the St Andrews brigade."

Lance Caswell, who along with his partner, children and relatives was cornered in his home by rising floodwaters, said there was some relief after initial reports of rising tides. ""We thought it was going to come up really high; it's calm here."" Houses in the surrounding suburb of Goodna, where Mr Caswell lives, were still submerged, he said. ""There is still always a worry, especially with little ones. ""One of our neighbours has a sick daughter and they need to get her to a hospital; police and emergency services are going around in boats."" He said service stations were running out of fuel and there had been reports of fights breaking out as people waiting to get supplies became impatient. ""The water is stagnant, water is rubbish ... they say water is safe to drink where we are, although we are still boiling water. ""It's going to be at least a week before all this gets cleaned up."" Mr Caswell's relatives were forced to stay at his home after they were turned back by roadblocks - forcing them to leave their home in the suburb of Plainland. His 12-year-old son has had to stay in a neighbouring suburb after flooding cut them off. Meanwhile, it was business as usual for former Timaru resident Philippa Vette, who was back at work yesterday. Her family, including expat Kiwi husband Ross, a firefighter, had escaped the floods but were dealing with the shock being felt throughout Brisbane. ""It's all pretty quiet at work today; the people who are affected haven't come in. People are dealing with their own problems."" She said a lot of businesses and shops were closed while water, bread and milk stocks were low. However, there was a ""tremendous"" community spirit, she said. ""Street teams are going out to help people out and clean up; a whole lot of older women have been baking up a storm, also hampers. ""There is a lot of activation in the community, strangers helping each other out."" Ad Feedback"

Yolette Etienne speaks with young survivors days after the earthquake destroyed much of Port-au-Prince. Photo by Liz Lucas/Oxfam America I met Yolette Etienne about a year ago in the midst of chaos and sorrow. It was less than two weeks after the earthquake had turned Haiti's capital into a sea of dust and ruin, killing more than 220,000 people-Yolette's mother among them. Still, Yolette came to work each day at Oxfam through the snarl of traffic backed up behind the rubble, reminders of all that was lost at every turn, a heartbreaking beginning to days that seemed to have no end. How did she manage? I don't know. But she did, with a warmth I felt instantly, even though I was a stranger and had arrived at a terrible time. And when I asked about going to church, it was Yolette who said, yes! Let's go. It was a Sunday and strangely still, the air heavy with people longing for normalcy. I thought they might find it in church, with prayer, with song. Yolette borrowed a truck and we set out through the moonscape of Port-au-Prince in search of a service. She knew the roads by heart, and the shortcuts, too-even without the landmarks that had once defined the neighborhoods. We stopped at Eglise de la Communauté Evangelique D'Haiti: its doors were open wide and parishioners packed just about every seat. Yolette let me out-and with a flash of a smile, she was gone. A few weeks ago, I met Yolette again, this time as a colleague with whom I'll be working even more closely: She is now the director of Oxfam America's new program in Haiti. I was back in the country to report on the work Oxfam had undertaken since the quake-the more than 500,000 survivors it has helped with water and sanitation, shelter and jobs, and the 700,000 others it is reaching with a massive program to stem the spread of cholera that has now swept into every province. Her smile? It was still same, but this time she embraced me-and a deep conversation followed about the hardships Haitians have endured these many months since the quake, and the patience and hard work all must summon for the long road ahead. © 2011 Oxfam America Inc.

The backbone of Bela Shehu's new line, NINO, is shape. Or maybe it's versatility, or perhaps function. The point is that it's nearly impossible to pinpoint one aspect as the most dominate thread in her work. The forces that come through in her designs are like some animated trifecta of superheroes, each with its own special badass power - and together they create something unstoppable. Partially inspired by the stylings of Joan Shepp, NINO is a juxtaposition of boxy and sleek. Curved spines bend the silhouette and push out the back of a jacket or dress. And tubular sleeves - a favorite of Shehu's - make an appearance on many of her tops, boleros and her famous cape, which comes in three different lengths, creating three dramatic stand-alone statements. Try the longer one for ladylike, timeless appeal; the shorter one comes across as casual and youthful; and the teeny, tiny one is playful and sprightly.

Click their image to see some other key Cracker Barrel music releases. Traditional bluegrass isn't often recorded with electric instruments, and most country music doesn't feature mandolin and banjo solos, but Terry Eldredge and the rest of The Grascals would rather pick and sing than parse definitions. The band has spent the past six years ignoring genre lines already blurred by decades of country/bluegrass interminglings from forerunners including Earl Scruggs and The Osborne Brothers. With The Grascals' new album, those lines continue to be blurred - and at times erased altogether. The Grascals & Friends: Country Classics With a Bluegrass Spin finds the bluegrass band making its debut on the Cracker Barrel imprint, delivering classic country songs with help from Brad Paisley, Dierks Bentley (who counts Eldredge as a primary influence), Dolly Parton, Tom T. Hall, Joe Nichols, The Oak Ridge Boys, Darryl Worley and Charlie Daniels. The album is now available at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store locations. Singing bluegrass in country settings, or performing country songs bluegrass-style, comes easily to Eldredge. ""My heroes are George Jones and (bluegrass legend) Bobby Osborne, and I'm totally influenced by both of them,"" he says. ""I have a lot of country in me, but my roots are in 'grass.' "" Grascals member Jamie Johnson (not to be confused with country artist Jamey Johnson), says the key to melding the two sounds is attitude. ""You just get up there, smile and kick 'em right in the (posterior),"" he says. ""Dolly Parton told us if you open your heart to the people and have fun, they'll open their hearts to you, and they'll want you back."" Formed in 2004 and the winner of the International Bluegrass Music Association's top entertainer award in 2006 and 2007, The Grascals have already booked more concert dates for 2011 than the band played in 2010. The Cracker Barrel deal is one reason for that, as the store's approach of releasing one exclusive bluegrass release per year offers something like pole position for sales and acclaim. What Starbucks did for Norah Jones, Cracker Barrel is offering on a homier level for bluegrassers: In 2010, duo Dailey & Vincent won the IBMA's album of the year prize and debuted at No. 19 on Billboard's Country Albums Chart with another Cracker Barrel bluegrass/country collision, Dailey & Vincent Sing the Statler Brothers. Before that, Alison Krauss & Union Station's Cracker Barrel exclusive, Home on the Highways, was also a hit. ""When you see people like Zac Brown and Smokey Robinson getting in line to do Cracker Barrel albums, that's a no-brainer,"" Johnson says. ""Somebody's paying attention over there. They're not just eating chicken and dumplings, they're buying music."" A little help from friends The Grascals had been interested in teaming with Cracker Barrel for years, and the end of their four-album deal with Rounder Records enabled the pairing. The band had recorded in the past with Bentley, George Jones, Hank Williams Jr., Vince Gill, Steve Wariner and other country-identified artists, and an album of collaborations seemed like a natural. For the new disc, the group decided to augment its core mix - Eldredge and Johnson's acoustic guitar and vocals, Terry Smith's bass and harmonies, Danny Roberts' vocals and mandolin, Jeremy Abshire's fiddle and Kristin Scott Benson's banjo and guitar - with drums, piano, electric guitar, accordion and steel guitar, all of which are more commonly associated with country than with bluegrass. They recorded basic tracks and left spaces for their all-star guests to fill in. The Nitty Gritty Dirty Band hit ""Mr. Bojangles"" is recast with Joe Nichols' buttery baritone (""The best male voice in country music since Keith Whitley,"" Johnson said) forwarding the story, while Dolly Parton's ""The Pain of Loving You"" offers an unusual (and pleasing) banjo/steel guitar interplay and a peppier tempo than the original. ""There's pressure each time you do something like this,"" Eldredge says. ""We recorded Dolly's 'The Pain of Loving You' and wondered how she'd like it."" He was well-familiar with Parton, an early supporter of the band who brought The Grascals out with her on tour in 2004. But familiarity doesn't always breed confidence, particularly around legendary types. ""One of the first things she said that day was, 'I love this track,' "" Eldredge adds. ""That was a good thing. Then the sweat beads stopped, at least until I had to go in and sing with her."" The Grascals wanted to be sure that she and other guests enjoyed the music. They did, and no one in the studio complained that the steel guitar-filled ""I Am Strong"" didn't fit the traditional bluegrass model established by Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys in the 1940s, or that the swinging ""Tiger by the Tail"" featuring Brad Paisley didn't follow the raw and edgy Bakersfield Sound model that marked Buck Owens' original. Johnson says country audiences don't mind the cross-pollination, either, even when the band brings fiddles and banjos to otherwise amped-up, multi-act festivals. ""We never get anything negative back from the fans. They love it,"" Johnson says. ""We don't take a back seat to nobody, man. We're as good as a lot of the country bands dreamed of being, we just don't have the amplifiers to cover up our mistakes."" Reach Peter Cooper at 615-259-8220 or pcooper@tennessean.com.

Home » Sports Iranian NCAA Player Shoots for the NBA Tala Hadavi on January 13, 2011 - 3:16 pm No Comment When Iranian basketball national team star, Arsalan Kazemi, enrolled at Rice University in the fall of 2009, he became the first Iranian to play major college basketball in the United States. Now, the 20 year old is widely considered a top prospect to play professional basketball with the NBA. Things have changed since Arsalan Kazemi's Iranian parents enrolled their son at a prep school in North Carolina. The gamble paid off when basketball powerhouses such as Memphis, Maryland and Oklahoma State all offered him full athletic scholarships. ""I didn't want to sit on the bench for an entire year my freshman year,"" says Kazemi in Farsi, his native language. ""It just doesn't work with my mentality and secondly, because Rice is a very good school academically, I knew I could get a great job after graduating from here."" That great job might have to wait. After a successful freshman year at Rice, scouts noticed Arsalan at the basketball World Championships in Turkey last summer. ""My first year here everyone talked about me being the first-ever Iranian to receive a scholarship in the NCAA,"" says Kazemi. ""That's why it was such a good feeling after the world championships. Then, everyone, all the reporters all of a sudden started talking about basketball with me and telling me I'm a great player and that I have a future. It was a great feeling."" A reporter for Slam Magazine picked Arsalan as one of the top five NBA prospects of the tournament. ""After this year I'd really like to sign up for the draft, practice with teams to compare myself to other players and see what areas I need to improve upon"" says Arsalan, ""then come back for my junior year at Rice, work on those areas and then make the move fully after that season."" Arsalan might not need to look that far to determine the areas of his game that need improvement. His head coach at Rice, Ben Braun, knows a thing or two about what needs work. ""The next step for Arsalan, he's now got to go out and guard some quicker guards. He is very quick off the dribble, he can get to the basket, he can finish,"" says Braun. ""He is knocking down his free throws now. So his game is really starting to come around. If he can just add that element of improving his range on his jump shot, then the sky is the limit, then he becomes almost an impossible player to guard."" Entering the NBA draft before graduation requires careful calculation. Any player who signs with an agent loses his college eligibility. Anthony Ibrahim, a former TNT basketball analyst, discovered Arsalan when he competed for the Iranian junior national team. He's been the athlete's mentor since bringing Arsalan to the United States. ""I would love for him to go this year but I think he still needs another year of seasoning,"" says Ibrahim. ""We're going to evaluate him at the end of this season. I'm going to give him the best advice, like I did for him when I brought him to this country. When the NBA scouts or the general managers of the NBA that I know give me the green light, I will present him the facts and he has to make the decision."" But until the NBA comes calling, Arsalan plans to enjoy life as a college student. And although he is 12,000 kilometers away from home, Iran remains close to his heart. His national team jersey proudly hangs in his dorm room and he's poised to break some barriers. ""Arsalan is a pioneer,"" says Braun, his coach. ""He has really paved the way and I told him that that's quite an honor. It's not a burden, it's an honor and a privilege. I know he feels sometimes the pressure of wanting to succeed, so other people in fact can succeed, so he takes it very personally and I know he doesn't want to let anybody down.""

Super Bowl titles in 1987 and 1991, will serve six years probation. ""She told me she was 19,"" Taylor said in court as he admitted having sex with a prostitute who turned out to be a 16-year-old Bronx runaway. Harry Carson, his former teammate and fellow Hall of Famer, was in the courtroom and gave Taylor a supportive greeting when he arrived. » Nazareth community updates delivered to your mobile phone. Text NAZARETH to 52270! Message and data rates apply. Taylor was arrested in May at a suburban hotel. He previously had pleaded not guilty to third-degree rape, patronizing a prostitute, sexual abuse and endangering a child. He had been resisting a plea deal for months. Prosecutors said in December he had been offered a six-month jail term and 10 years' probation in exchange for pleading guilty to a felony. Taylor would have had to register as a sex offender. Defense attorney Arthur Aidala had called that offer unacceptable but said he would listen to any other offers. Two other members of the Giants' 1991 Super Bowl team are behind bars. Mark Ingram Sr., a star receiver, is spending nearly 10 years in federal prison for money laundering, bank fraud and bail jumping. And the electrifying kick returner Dave Meggett was sentenced last year to 30 years for criminal sexual conduct and burglary. Taylor's trial would likely have started within a few weeks. He was arrested May 6 after the underage girl's uncle contacted New York City police. Officers from Ramapo woke him at a Holiday Inn in Montebello. Police said he was cooperative and no drugs were found in the room, although a bottle of alcohol was. Taylor has a history of drug offenses but has been to rehab and his lawyer says he has been sober for years. In a related case, federal prosecutors in Manhattan filed a complaint last year against a man who is accused of acting as the girl's pimp. Court papers in that case say Taylor admitted to sex acts with the girl but said he was told the girl was 19. Ramapo police Chief Peter Brower said after Taylor's arrest that ignorance of a minor's age is not a defense to third-degree rape. Aidala had claimed that Taylor's arrest was illegal because police did not have a warrant when they burst into his suburban hotel room in May. Prosecutors said no warrant was required and state Supreme Court Justice William Kelly rejected the claim. But he granted a pretrial hearing on whether statements Taylor made upon his arrest were admissible.

Then, Jackie Chan took on the role of twin brothers in TWIN DRAGONS (1992). In the wake of the American B-movie circuit, filmmaker Jon Steven Ward used the idea to have twin brothers as the lead characters. The difference between this film and the others? The ""twins"" of the film are actual twin brothers and martial artists. Dave (Joe Gates) and Josh (Jay Gates) Conner are twin brothers who are skilled in the martial art of taekwondo. While Josh spends most of his time at the school, Dave is a champion fighter who is given attitude by his last opponent, Bobby Souk (Krist Geriene). Bobby is the head instructor of a new kung fu school that opened. However, the school is actually a cover for mob boss Donald Moss (Joe Estevez), who is planning a counterfeit ring. Meanwhile, Dave and his wife Karen (Nicolette Vatjay) try to make amends with Josh, who after a bar fights, meets Allison (Nikka Bailey), Bobby's girlfriend. Allison has grown tired of Bobby's attitude and plans to leave him. Meanwhile, the Conner brothers accidentally get themselves involved with Moss when they stop Moss' gang from going after the man hired to counterfeit Moss' money, Barman (Edgar Bailey). During the melee, Dave kicks a gunman and Barman is killed by a bullet to the head. When Josh sees the money, he takes it and runs. When Moss gets wind, his attempt to grab Josh ends up resulting in Dave being kidnapped. With no help from the police, Josh finds a potential ally in Ray Tobin (Robert Z'Dar), a bounty hunter hired to do jobs the police dare not touch. Together, Josh and Ray must work together to save Dave and Allison from the clutches of Moss before it's too late. While it is true that the ""twin fighter"" genre had been done to death, this is quite an interesting film. While many may feel this is a rip-off of DOUBLE IMPACT (1992) and TWIN DRAGONS (1992), there are very notable differences between this film and the previous two. First, there is no separation at birth in this film. Second, there is no Corsican Brothers-like concept of feeling each other's pain. This is just a standard action film that stars twin brothers who are martial artists involving themselves with a counterfeit ring resulting in one brother being kidnapped. The twin brothers of the film are Jay and Joe Gates, experts in the Korean art of taekwondo. They are protege of Edgar Bailey, who appears in the film as counterfeiter Barman. While Bailey himself doesn't have any fight scenes, it is the Gates brothers who shine. They bring a traditional style of the art to the film. They are quite some master kickers with fluidity in their aerials. While there are no flashy style acrobatics like in some of today's martial arts films, the style here consists of power punches, jumping kicks, and even some nice flying angle kicks. Even the actor playing the main fighting villain, Krist Geriene, is quite a martial artist who doesn't have too many fight scenes, but impresses when he does fight the Gates twins. Of course, this being the only film to feature the Gates twins, there has to be a bit of ""B-movie star power"" adding to the flair. Robert Z'Dar, who is best known for his role as killer policeman Matt Cordell in the MANIAC COP trilogy, brings very little to the role of bounty hunter Ray Tobin. He gets only one major action scene and spends the rest of the film either drinking or trying to get it on with women. As for Joe Estevez, the brother of A-list actor Martin Sheen, he overplays his main villain role of Donald Moss. He spends most of the film grimacing and screaming, a typical character in B-movies.

Had it been possible for Garrison Keillor and Sam Kinison to have a child together, the result could easily have been Mike Daisey. Sometimes laconic, occasionally folksy and full to the brim with killer-cogent observations like Keillor, Daisey, who's performing his solo show ""The Last Cargo Cult"" at Berkeley Repertory Theatre, also invokes Kinison with rafter-rattling screams and strings of world-class profanity. He is also uniquely Daisey, delivering his monologues in ""Cargo"" in front of a mountain of boxes for consumer goods, ranging from baby stuff to computers. He performs, as is his custom, seated behind a table and armed with a glass of water, a few pages of notes and a dark handkerchief to stanch his profuse perspiration. His amazing stock-in-trade is his ability to begin discussing two seemingly separated-by-miles topics -- in this case the South Pacific island of Tanna, where people worship the vast riches and technological advances of the United States (hence the name ""Cargo Cult""), and Americans' love of money yet ignorance of the banking and investment system that nearly brought us to ruin. He manages to bring both topics together, make sense of them and make us realize we have much more in common with this remote island than we might believe. Daisey says he performs his shows extemporaneously, relying only on notes and memories of pervious performances of the piece at hand. It's difficult to say how much the show changes from night to night, but the key thing is that Daisey is a delightful performer with a mastery of words and a seeming fondness for working without a net. His approach keeps the show fresh and gives the performer a chance to run with a notion if the inspiration hits. Wednesday's opening night of ""Cargo Cult"" (which will be performed in repertory with another Daisey piece, ""The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs"" starting Jan. 23), offered plenty to satisfy the solo performer's fans. OK, the show ran a little long, but the brilliance of Daisey was enough to forgive anything, even a little trickery played on the audience. As the patrons filed in, they were given a piece of genuine U.S. currency -- the bills included ones, fives, 10s, 20s, 50s and even 100s -- which were held in sweaty hands throughout most of the show. It's a lesson, as it turns out, on our fondness for money, even if it's only worth the amount printed on it because we believe it to be. Toward the end, Daisey explains all of this. He says you can keep the cash -- but chances are, you'll give it back. All of this works wonderfully primarily because of Daisey's amazing word wrangling -- not only does he know where to find a story, but he knows how to tell is better than just about anyone. The best illustration of this is his tale of the South Pacific, particularly the puddle-jumper airplane flight to the small island he was visiting to attend the John Frum Day celebration (in honor of a mythical figure who promised that Western-style riches would come to the island) by practitioners of the cargo cult. On his way to a town on the edge of a very active volcano, Daisey has a brush with death as his plane hydroplanes on a flooded airstrip and spins and skids to a halt. Then there's the nine-hour John Frum Day celebration, which glorifies the American way of life introduced to the island nearly 70 years ago when U.S. forces built an airstrip on the island an promptly abandoned it. It all seems quaint and silly until Daisy gets into the highly sophisticated American banking and monetary system and how it is based on much weaker myth and folklore than the John Frum legend. He also talks about sleeping with a pig and teetering on the rim of a volcano in two of many entertaining asides that are as much a part of the Daisey style as his occasional bellow.

A memorial service is no place for the cheers and applause. But the noise was perfect. Not because the president's words were powerful, though they were, but because the scene matched this moment of noisy distractions. The solemnity of the event was interrupted in the same way the period after the shooting has been interrupted by the political debate. (watch a clip at left) The president's job was to move past both--to get a message out and through the noise so the country could hear. If it can be done, he did it. The president memorialized the dead and celebrated the heroes. He could have stopped there. He could have decided not to tarnish their memory with politics. He made another decision, using just enough politics and the power of his office to build a memorial to their lives by calling the rest of us to live up to their example. That they are deserving of our good example. That was the message. He used that expression when talking about our children but it was his request of the country. ""What, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward? How can we honor the fallen? How can we be true to their memory?"" The president did not ask us to put away passion but to act with restraint. It was not a call to stop fighting but to stop fighting dirty. He didn't just issue orders. By holding up the examples of the lives well lived--and worthy of the applause they received--he hoped to draw us to the lesson. The president was a speaker, but he was also a participant. ""They help me believe,"" he said. Later, referring to Christina Taylor Green, he said: ""I want to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it."" On the 50th anniversary of John Kennedy's inauguration, the president wisely did not refer back to the famous line from his predecessor. It has been quoted too often. (The text he quoted from, twice, was the Bible.) But the message of the speech was similar: Citizenship demands something of us. In a sense this was a familiar moment: more words from an eloquent president. But it was more than that. Carefully arranged words are an antidote and an example. In a world of quick, loud, and lazy opinions, it's refreshing to have a speech that feels as though it were typeset. There was no shortage of emotion in the speech, but it did not stretch beyond what was required. As any good writer knows, conveying powerful emotions effectively requires restraint. That's a message that also applies to our political debate. Text of Obama's Speech More than eloquence, the president also offered an argument, one he has been We know that's his way . But the speech wasn't just the product of an all-nighter. It came from someone who thinks about children and the obligations of being a parent, who knows how it feels to be startled by your desperate love for a spouse whom you might have taken for granted in the rush of the day. The president may not be emotional. But you can't write that speech if you're all ice water. What do we want in a president? The office has become so misshapen it's hard to say what it doesn't encompass. Giving speeches isn't the entire job, of course. But if part of the job requirement is someone who reminds us that our public life can reflect our best private selves, then Obama showed that he is up to it.

(watch a clip at left) The president's job was to move past both--to get a message out and through the noise so the country could hear. If it can be done, he did it. The president memorialized the dead and celebrated the heroes. He could have stopped there. He could have decided not to tarnish their memory with politics. He made another decision, using just enough politics and the power of his office to build a memorial to their lives by calling the rest of us to live up to their example. That they are deserving of our good example. That was the message. He used that expression when talking about our children but it was his request of the country. ""What, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward? How can we honor the fallen? How can we be true to their memory?"" The president did not ask us to put away passion but to act with restraint. It was not a call to stop fighting but to stop fighting dirty. He didn't just issue orders. By holding up the examples of the lives well lived--and worthy of the applause they received--he hoped to draw us to the lesson. The president was a speaker, but he was also a participant. ""They help me believe,"" he said. Later, referring to Christina Taylor Green, he said: ""I want to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it."" On the 50th anniversary of John Kennedy's inauguration, the president wisely did not refer back to the famous line from his predecessor. It has been quoted too often. (The text he quoted from, twice, was the Bible.) But the message of the speech was similar: Citizenship demands something of us. In a sense this was a familiar moment: more words from an eloquent president. But it was more than that. Carefully arranged words are an antidote and an example. In a world of quick, loud, and lazy opinions, it's refreshing to have a speech that feels as though it were typeset. There was no shortage of emotion in the speech, but it did not stretch beyond what was required. As any good writer knows, conveying powerful emotions effectively requires restraint. That's a message that also applies to our political debate. Text of Obama's Speech More than eloquence, the president also offered an argument, one he has been We know that's his way . But the speech wasn't just the product of an all-nighter. It came from someone who thinks about children and the obligations of being a parent, who knows how it feels to be startled by your desperate love for a spouse whom you might have taken for granted in the rush of the day. The president may not be emotional. But you can't write that speech if you're all ice water. What do we want in a president? The office has become so misshapen it's hard to say what it doesn't encompass. Giving speeches isn't the entire job, of course. But if part of the job requirement is someone who reminds us that our public life can reflect our best private selves, then Obama showed that he is up to it.

A memorial service is no place for the cheers and applause. But the noise was perfect. Not because the president's words were powerful, though they were, but because the scene matched this moment of noisy distractions. The solemnity of the event was interrupted in the same way the period after the shooting has been interrupted by the political debate. (watch a clip at left) The president's job was to move past both--to get a message out and through the noise so the country could hear. If it can be done, he did it. The president memorialized the dead and celebrated the heroes. He could have stopped there. He could have decided not to tarnish their memory with politics. He made another decision, using just enough politics and the power of his office to build a memorial to their lives by calling the rest of us to live up to their example. That they are deserving of our good example. That was the message. He used that expression when talking about our children but it was his request of the country. ""What, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward? How can we honor the fallen? How can we be true to their memory?"" The president did not ask us to put away passion but to act with restraint. It was not a call to stop fighting but to stop fighting dirty. He didn't just issue orders. By holding up the examples of the lives well lived--and worthy of the applause they received--he hoped to draw us to the lesson. The president was a speaker, but he was also a participant. ""They help me believe,"" he said. Later, referring to Christina Taylor Green, he said: ""I want to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it."" On the 50th anniversary of John Kennedy's inauguration, the president wisely did not refer back to the famous line from his predecessor. It has been quoted too often. (The text he quoted from, twice, was the Bible.) But the message of the speech was similar: Citizenship demands something of us. In a sense this was a familiar moment: more words from an eloquent president. But it was more than that. Carefully arranged words are an antidote and an example. In a world of quick, loud, and lazy opinions, it's refreshing to have a speech that feels as though it were typeset. There was no shortage of emotion in the speech, but it did not stretch beyond what was required. As any good writer knows, conveying powerful emotions effectively requires restraint. That's a message that also applies to our political debate. Text of Obama's Speech More than eloquence, the president also offered an argument, one he has been We know that's his way . But the speech wasn't just the product of an all-nighter. It came from someone who thinks about children and the obligations of being a parent, who knows how it feels to be startled by your desperate love for a spouse whom you might have taken for granted in the rush of the day. The president may not be emotional. But you can't write that speech if you're all ice water. What do we want in a president? The office has become so misshapen it's hard to say what it doesn't encompass. Giving speeches isn't the entire job, of course. But if part of the job requirement is someone who reminds us that our public life can reflect our best private selves, then Obama showed that he is up to it. He has been thinking about that idea long before this tragedy called for a speech about it. The test for all of us is to do the same after the applause has died down.

"Breaking News: CBS News","How Obama's Speech Elevated Political Debate","2011-01-13T08:29:32Z","2011-01-13T08:29:32Z","www.cbsnews.com","http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20028462-503544.html","Top Breaking News Stories from CBSNews.com","","","In Tucson Wednesday night, it sounded like a campaign rally. A memorial service is no place for the cheers and applause. But the noise was perfect. Not because the president's words were powerful, though they were, but because the scene matched this moment of noisy distractions. The solemnity of the event was interrupted in the same way the period after the shooting has been interrupted by the political debate. (watch a clip at left) The president's job was to move past both--to get a message out and through the noise so the country could hear. If it can be done, he did it. The president memorialized the dead and celebrated the heroes. He could have stopped there. He could have decided not to tarnish their memory with politics. He made another decision, using just enough politics and the power of his office to build a memorial to their lives by calling the rest of us to live up to their example. That they are deserving of our good example. That was the message. He used that expression when talking about our children but it was his request of the country. ""What, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward? How can we honor the fallen? How can we be true to their memory?"" The president did not ask us to put away passion but to act with restraint. It was not a call to stop fighting but to stop fighting dirty. He didn't just issue orders. By holding up the examples of the lives well lived--and worthy of the applause they received--he hoped to draw us to the lesson. The president was a speaker, but he was also a participant. ""They help me believe,"" he said. Later, referring to Christina Taylor Green, he said: ""I want to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it."" On the 50th anniversary of John Kennedy's inauguration, the president wisely did not refer back to the famous line from his predecessor. It has been quoted too often. (The text he quoted from, twice, was the Bible.) But the message of the speech was similar: Citizenship demands something of us. In a sense this was a familiar moment: more words from an eloquent president. But it was more than that. Carefully arranged words are an antidote and an example. In a world of quick, loud, and lazy opinions, it's refreshing to have a speech that feels as though it were typeset. There was no shortage of emotion in the speech, but it did not stretch beyond what was required. As any good writer knows, conveying powerful emotions effectively requires restraint. That's a message that also applies to our political debate. Text of Obama's Speech More than eloquence, the president also offered an argument, one he has been We know that's his way . But the speech wasn't just the product of an all-nighter. It came from someone who thinks about children and the obligations of being a parent, who knows how it feels to be startled by your desperate love for a spouse whom you might have taken for granted in the rush of the day. The president may not be emotional. But you can't write that speech if you're all ice water. What do we want in a president? The office has become so misshapen it's hard to say what it doesn't encompass. Giving speeches isn't the entire job, of course. But if part of the job requirement is someone who reminds us that our public life can reflect our best private selves, then Obama showed that he is up to it. He has been thinking about that idea long before this tragedy called for a speech about it. The test for all of us is to do the same after the applause has died down.

According to ""high-level sources,"" Sony has already consulted with third-party developers about the system's launch and the timing of its first wave of games. Probably the most exciting factor is that Sony is evidently requesting ""richer, more in-depth content to differentiate its device from app-centric Apple and Android devices,"" with Sony telling developers the PSP 2 ""is as powerful as the PlayStation 3"" (which seems to corroborate a past rumor that the PSP 2's graphical capabilities will be comparable with the PS3). The report also states the PSP 2 will run games using some kind of physical media (although what type wasn't specified) in order to ""make sure retail has a part to play in the console's lifecycle."" It will also have access to downloadable software, but that'll be more along the lines of smaller games and apps downloaded from the PlayStation Store, as opposed to full games like with the PSP Go."

Read about our winners (and runners-up) along with our reasons behind each winning pick, and check out how similar (or different) your choices are. It sounds kind of terrible in concept: ""Tomb Raider, but now as a twin-stick shooter!"" In actual execution, it's perhaps one of the finest action games to hit hard drives in years. The top-down perspective, the tight and responsive controls, the cooperative gameplay (with actual honest-to-god designed-for-co-op puzzles as well), and the addictive and numerous challenges all combine to make this one of the best games featuring Lara Croft in years. Now Infinity Blade Chair Entertainment | Chair Entertainment As bizarre as it sounds, an addictive mash-up of Punch-Out!! and Demon's Souls that looks like a modern HD game, but is portable enough to fit in your iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad, actually works. While a great many games are simple-and-addictive, and others (like Infinity Blade (11%) Best PC Game MineCraft (12%) Best PSP Game Great U.S. releases were few and far between on the rapidly fading PSP last year -- but even on a healthier platform, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker would have stood out as something special. An extraordinary distillation of the Metal Gear concept into a modern portable title, Peace Walker side-stepped the flaws of its most recent console chapter (namely, the drawn-out cut-scenes), and focused instead on compact, cleverly designed missions with tons of Heavy Rain Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. | Quantic Dream The story of Super Mario Galaxy 2 is a triumph of design. In what is easily the most celebrated and iconic of franchises and the most well-known of characters, Nintendo has (again) managed to collect their vast experience, expertise, and dedication into a platformer magnificent in its simplicity. As Justin Haywald wrote in his Best Action Game....Bayonetta??? Bulls#$%! ghostman2k78 Bayonetta...for real??? Over God of War 3...how? I'm calling for a recount. Split Second should not have won... ghostman2k78 That's what I'm saying- they need to vote again, and think about the decision...but not for long, because it's really not that tough of a choice between the two.

A memorial service is no place for the cheers and applause. But the noise was perfect. Not because the president's words were powerful, though they were, but because the scene matched this moment of noisy distractions. The solemnity of the event was interrupted in the same way the period after the shooting has been interrupted by the political debate. (watch a clip at left) The president's job was to move past both--to get a message out and through the noise so the country could hear. If it can be done, he did it. The president memorialized the dead and celebrated the heroes. He could have stopped there. He could have decided not to tarnish their memory with politics. He made another decision, using just enough politics and the power of his office to build a memorial to their lives by calling the rest of us to live up to their example. That they are deserving of our good example. That was the message. He used that expression when talking about our children but it was his request of the country. ""What, beyond prayers and expressions of concern, is required of us going forward? How can we honor the fallen? How can we be true to their memory?"" The president did not ask us to put away passion but to act with restraint. It was not a call to stop fighting but to stop fighting dirty. He didn't just issue orders. By holding up the examples of the lives well lived--and worthy of the applause they received--he hoped to draw us to the lesson. The president was a speaker, but he was also a participant. ""They help me believe,"" he said. Later, referring to Christina Taylor Green, he said: ""I want to live up to her expectations. I want our democracy to be as good as Christina imagined it. I want America to be as good as she imagined it."" On the 50th anniversary of John Kennedy's inauguration, the president wisely did not refer back to the famous line from his predecessor. It has been quoted too often. (The text he quoted from, twice, was the Bible.) But the message of the speech was similar: Citizenship demands something of us. In a sense this was a familiar moment: more words from an eloquent president. But it was more than that. Carefully arranged words are an antidote and an example. In a world of quick, loud, and lazy opinions, it's refreshing to have a speech that feels as though it were typeset. There was no shortage of emotion in the speech, but it did not stretch beyond what was required. As any good writer knows, conveying powerful emotions effectively requires restraint. That's a message that also applies to our political debate. Text of Obama's Speech More than eloquence, the president also offered an argument, one he has been We know that's his way . But the speech wasn't just the product of an all-nighter. It came from someone who thinks about children and the obligations of being a parent, who knows how it feels to be startled by your desperate love for a spouse whom you might have taken for granted in the rush of the day. The president may not be emotional. But you can't write that speech if you're all ice water. What do we want in a president? The office has become so misshapen it's hard to say what it doesn't encompass. Giving speeches isn't the entire job, of course. But if part of the job requirement is someone who reminds us that our public life can reflect our best private selves, then Obama showed that he is up to it. He has been thinking about that idea long before this tragedy called for a speech about it. The test for all of us is to do the same after the applause has died down.

The world's top cocoa grower has been locked in a violent power struggle since a November 28 election which both Gbagbo and his rival Alassane Ouattara claim to have won. The United Nations says Ouattara won the vote, but Gbagbo, who came to power in 2000, has rejected the U.N.-certified tally. In Geneva, U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay said armed forces were blocking access to a site near the central town of Daloa where a mass grave had been reported, as they have already been accused of doing at sites in and around Abidjan. U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said in a statement that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was ""deeply concerned that regular and irregular forces loyal to Mr. Gbagbo have begun to attack and burn United Nations vehicles."" ""Beginning this morning, there have been a total of six incidents involving such attacks in Abidjan where a UNOCI military vehicle was burned,"" he said, referring to the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Ivory Coast. There was also a stone-throwing attack on an ambulance in which the driver and doctor were injured, U.N. officials said. ""ANGRY MOBS"" U.N. officials told Reuters privately that the situation in Abidjan was becoming increasingly tense and confrontational. They say that Gbagbo's forces have shifted their tactics away from military confrontations and are now encouraging crowds of people to attack UNOCI vehicles instead. This has made it increasingly difficult for UNOCI, which has some 10,000 troops and police in Ivory Coast, to respond to the attacks, since they do not want to injure civilians. ""Gbagbo's setting angry mobs loose on UNOCI,"" a U.N. diplomat said. ""If they fire into a crowd all hell will break loose."" U.N. officials said they were concerned that Gbagbo was trying to provoke UNOCI into firing on civilians in order to spark a massive backlash that would force UNOCI to withdraw. Gbabgo ordered UNOCI out of Ivory Coast last month, but the United Nations has refused to recognize his authority to make such decisions. The U.N. Security Council was expected to approve a 2,000-troop increase for UNOCI on Friday, but diplomats said the vote had been postponed until next week. The November election was meant to heal a nation divided into a government-held south and a rebel-run north by a 2002-2003 civil war, but has instead only deepened divisions. Gbagbo controls the security forces and allied militias, which U.N. officials suspect of rights abuses. The stand-off has sent cocoa prices to four-month highs in recent weeks. REPORTS OF MASS GRAVE Pillay told Reuters in Geneva about reports of a third mass grave in Ivory Coast that is off-limits to U.N. personnel. ""I am very concerned now that a third mass grave has been discovered,"" she said. ""Not only my representative there but the U.N. representative has not been allowed access to the mass graves."" The U.N. suspects many of the dead were killed by pro-Gbagbo security forces or allied militias in night-time raids on neighborhoods, with hundreds more abducted. Gbagbo's camp has repeatedly dismissed reports of mass graves and ""death squads"" as fabrications by Ouattara allies. U.N. officials say they are concerned about ethnic clashes in western Ivory Coast that have resulted in dozens of deaths. U.N. aid chief Valerie Amos warned of a potential humanitarian crisis. She said in a statement the recent violence had caused a 10-fold increase in the number of internal refugees in Ivory Coast, showing ""how quickly a political crisis can have grave humanitarian consequences."" Over 200 people have died in violence since the vote, and fears of more conflict have prompted more than 20,000 people to flee into neighboring Liberia, according to U.N. figures. Clashes in Abidjan between security forces loyal to Gbagbo and supporters of Ouattara killed six policemen and some civilians on Wednesday. Five died in another clash on Tuesday. Gbagbo's interior ministry said some of the police who died in Wednesday's clashes had been killed when their vehicle was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades. Ouattara's camp said Gbagbo's forces had killed at least seven civilians. Underlining the growing tensions between Gbagbo supporters and UNOCI, pro-Gbagbo students attacked and burned a U.N. pick-up truck in Abidjan on Thursday in one of the incidents Nesirky referred to in his statement. ""It's an opportunity for us to show that with our bare hands we can also take action,"" Max Amani, a student, said. ""Each day we hear shooting in Abobo we will burn 10 UNOCI cars,"" he said as others jumped up and down on the burned-out vehicle. Reuters witnesses saw a dozen armored vehicles ferrying troops with automatic weapons on patrol in the northern and largely pro-Ouattara neighborhoods of Abobo and Ayaman. Soldiers manned makeshift checkpoints to control traffic. ""The people still live in fear in Abobo,"" resident Ladji Bakayoko said."

Corruption is seen as the biggest barrier to foreign investment in Russia's oil-fueled $1.2 trillion economy. Medvedev, whose four-year term as president ends next year, made a fight against graft one of his priorities when he took office. ""You know the situation well. Let's admit that there are very few successes in this direction,"" Medvedev told a meeting of his Anti-Corruption Council, which includes ministers, senior aides and heads of law enforcement agencies. Berlin-based NGO Transparency International rated Russia joint 154th out of 178 nations in its corruption perceptions index, along with Cambodia, Kenya and Laos last year. The previous year Russia was ranked 146th. Failure to fight graft has hurt the stature of Medvedev, still seen as a junior partner in Russia's ruling tandem with his predecessor Vladimir Putin, now prime minister. One of the two is expected to stand in a presidential election in 2012. The head of Transparency's Russian office Yelena Panfilova said the anti-corruption drive was unlikely to gain traction before the election since authorities believe ""corruption does not hamper economic growth but instability does."" ""They are not ready to sacrifice stability for fighting corruption,"" Panfilova told Reuters. Medvedev gave no further details of his proposed new law, but said it would make it more difficult to set up shell companies such as those involved in ""large scale fraud linked to illegal transfer of assets abroad by a number of commercial banks"" that was uncovered last year by the central bank. ""In many cases (transactions) were a direct result of corruption-related crimes. The shell firms involved are being used as channels through which officials are receiving their kickbacks,"" he said. Medvedev said one success of his anti-corruption drive was that officials now have to declare their assets, although those declarations were often false. ""Take a look at who declared what,"" he told Moscow's new mayor, Sergei Sobyanin ""Otherwise one hears they have palaces outside the city but their declarations are negligible."" Russia has also announced plans to replace prison terms in bribery cases with large fines. Authorities say fines will be a better deterrent because corrupt officials sometimes accept jail knowing they can still enjoy their wealth when they go free."

The report to be published in Friday's edition of the journal Science says students who spend 10 minutes before an exam writing about their thoughts and feelings can free up brainpower previously occupied by testing worries and do their best work. ""We essentially got rid of this relationship between test anxiety and performance,"" said Sian L Beilock, an associate professor in psychology at the University of Chicago and co-author of the study with graduate student Gerardo Ramirez. Psychologists, educators and parents have known for a long time that the way students perform on a test does not necessarily indicate what knowledge they bring to the table. Test anxiety is fairly common in classrooms, especially in the United States because of its ""increasingly test-obsessed culture,"" Beilock said. Test anxiety can lead to poorer grades and lower scores on standardised tests and college entrance exams, which can condemn talented students to inferior colleges. The University of Chicago researchers found that students who were prone to test anxiety improved their test grades by nearly one grade point - from a B-minus to a B-plus, for example - if they were given 10 minutes before an exam to write about their feelings. The researchers tested their hypothesis with college students in a lab setting and with high school students in the classroom, by first gauging the level of test anxiety and then offering the writing intervention to some students. The researchers believe worrying competes for computing power in the brain's ""working,"" or short-term, memory. If working memory is focused on worrying, it can't help a person recall all the information his brain stored in preparation for the test. It also affects the working memory's ability to stay focused. Beilock said the ideafor the writing exercise came from the use of writing to combat depression. Expressive writing, in which people write repeatedly about a traumatic or emotional experience over several weeks or months, has been shown to decrease worrying in people who are depressed. Beilock believes this research is applicable to all kinds of performance anxiety - from giving a speech to interviewing for a job. ""There's a lot we can do to change how we think about the pressures and thus how we perform,"" she said. The next stage of the research project, which is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation, will involve a look inside the anxious brain to see how it changes during stressful situations, Beilock said."

Goondiwindi, a town of 6,000 west of Brisbane, was braced for flood waters to test river levees, with the Macintyre River expected to reach record levels early Friday morning. In its latest flood warning at 4am local time (1700GMT) the Bureau of Meteorology upgraded the threat to the town, saying waters will rise above the record 1996 peak of 10.6 metres on Friday morning. The warning prompted the precautionary evacuation of hospitals and nursing homes, but Goondiwindi mayor Graeme Scheu said he was confident the town's flood levees would hold. ""The levee bank is designed for 11 metres. We're expecting this to hold but we are in unchartered territory,"" he said, according to an AAP report. The clean-up was already under way in Brisbane, Australia's third-largest city, after water tore through the city , killing a 24-year-old man, submerging whole suburbs and turning property and infrastructure into debris. Focus: Floods cost to Australia 'higher than Katrina' Although the deluge failed to rise as high as predicted, at least 30,000 properties were swamped by muddy floodwaters, prompting Queensland's state premier Anna Bligh to describe the scene as a ""war zone"". The same weather system which has brought destruction to Queensland was set to sweep south bringing heavy rain and powerful gusts of wind to Victoria state, according to a State Emergency Service warning. In Brisbane shocked evacuees surveyed the damage after floods that have swept eastern Australia peaked about a metre (three feet) below feared levels around dawn on Thursday, sparing thousands more properties in the besieged river city. A tearful Bligh said Thursday relief was tinged with despair at the damage to homes and major landmarks, as well as the scale of the ""post-war"" rebuilding effort ahead for the city of two million people. ""I'm grateful Mother Nature hasn't been as terrible as she could have been, but people are waking up to unbearable agony across our city today,"" Bligh told Sky News. ""We've seen scenes of unbelievable devastation and destruction: entire suburbs where only rooftops can be glimpsed, whole big workplaces... are completely under water. ""Whole industrial parks (and) railway stations under water, bridges, roads all closed,"" she added. ""What I'm seeing looks more like a war zone in some places."" Scene: Houses, restaurants bob through stricken Brisbane At a news conference later in the day, Bligh said the floodwaters had forced 3,000 people into evacuation centres around the region and warned that for some it would be a long time before they could return home. A 24-year-old man became Brisbane's first victim, while two more bodies were found west of the city after Monday's flash floods wrecked a group of small towns. Fifteen people have now died in the past three days and rescuers continued their gruesome and painstaking search of communities shattered by Monday's flash floods, with dozens of people unaccounted for. The swollen Brisbane River, which runs through the centre of the Queensland state capital, was slowly beginning to recede, but the nervous city was reeling from its worst flooding since 1974. A massive 300-metre (300-yard) stretch of a popular concrete walkway that was perched above the river was ripped from its moorings and sped down the river, before being halted by the bravery of a quick-thinking tugboat pilot. A well-known floating restaurant was among dozens of vessels and pontoons also sent speeding down the waterway, while the downtown Suncorp Stadium resembled a giant swimming pool and the XXXX brewery was also flooded. Central Brisbane remained a ghost town after offices ordered workers to stay away and power was cut to more than 100,000 people in the region, as a safety measure to avoid electrical fires. Around 12,000 homes were completely flooded, some up to their roofs, and 13,700 were partly inundated with 5,000 businesses fully or partly hit, according to official estimates. Police started round-the-clock patrols in Brisbane and nearby Ipswich to deter looters, while the Australian Medical Association warned people to stay out of floodwaters to avoid infections.

""This is a major leap forward, this is a major milestone, and we're hoping that she crosses through many more,"" neurosurgeon Michael Lemole said on Thursday of Giffords, who remains in critical condition after Saturday's shooting. Doctors hope to get Giffords sitting up within days, they said, adding that she has been able to keep her eyes open for up to 15 minutes, at one point responding to the sound of the television in her room.

Ben Ali, who has been president since 1987, also ordered his security forces to stop using firearms against protesters and said prices for sugar, milk and bread would be reduced. He addressed the nation as the violence in the North African country brought more bloodshed and spread to the capital's centre. Two young men were shot dead in clashes with police in Sliman, about 40 km (25 miles) south of Tunis, witnesses told Reuters. At least five people suffered gunshot wounds in clashes with police in the centre of Tunis. The protesters say they are angry about unemployment, corruption and what they say is government repression. Officials say the protests have been hijacked by a minority of violent extremists who want to undermine Tunisia. In an emotional speech on Thursday evening -- delivered in local dialect instead of classical Arabic -- Ben Ali announced measures to try to calm the protests. ""I understand the Tunisians, I understand their demands. I am sad about what is happening now after 50 years of service to the country, military service, all the different posts, 23 years of the presidency,"" he said. He said he did not intend to be president for life and would not change the constitution, which states that no one over 75 years of age can run for the presidency. Ben Ali is 74 and it had been widely expected he would have the document amended to allow him to run for a new term. Ben Ali also promised price reductions for some basic foodstuffs and to allow a free press. The moves appeared to be welcomed. After the speech, people in the streets of one Tunis district sang the national anthem, a Reuters reporter said. Cars honked their horns in celebration. In El Omran neighbourhood, women poured into the street, breaking the curfew, shouting ""Viva Ben Ali"" and ululating. SHOOTING IN THE CITY Thursday had started with all shops in Tunis city centre closed and their shutters down. Armed soldiers, brought in to reinforce the police, stood guard outside government buildings behind banks of razor wire. In the Lafayette district, the main shopping area, gunshots rang out and I saw two civilians fall to the ground injured while three others ran away with bloody leg wounds. Nearby, black smoke billowed into the sky as people covered their mouths against the fumes and police blocked off the area, while more gunshots rang out. ""There was a protest and police used tear gas and gunfire to disperse the crowds,"" said a witness in a nearby street. The unrest, in its fourth week, had been confined to provincial towns and working class suburbs on the outskirts of the capital. France, the former colonial ruler and a close Tunisian ally, implicitly criticised the government's handling of the protests. ""We insist that all parties show restraint and choose the path of dialogue...we cannot continue with this disproportionate use of violence,"" Prime Minister Francois Fillon said on an official visit to London. The latest official count for the number of civilians killed in the unrest is 23. But witnesses told Reuters on Wednesday another five had been killed, while the United Nations said rights groups put the toll at almost 40. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said the deaths were ""a result of some excessive measures used, such as snipers (and) the indiscriminate killing of peaceful protesters."" [nLDE70C119] The government says police have only fired in self-defence when rioters attacked with petrol bombs and sticks. It also says death tolls from rights groups are inflated. On Wednesday Ben Ali sacked his interior minister and ordered the release of arrested rioters but people taking part in the clashes said that was not enough to meet their demands. A nightly curfew for Tunis and suburbs was introduced at 8 p.m. (1900 GMT) on Wednesday. The protests are being watched closely in other countries in the Arab world with the potential for social unrest, especially after rises in world food prices. Tourism, which accounted for 11 percent of Tunisia's hard currency earnings last year, may become vulnerable. One of the region's most open economies, the country has been attracting steady interest from foreign investors. The main Tunis stock market index fell 3.78 percent on Thursday, the fourth day of losses, taking it to a 12-month low. Credit default swaps -- or the cost of insuring exposure to Tunisian risk -- reached 18-month highs. [nLDE70C11W]"
